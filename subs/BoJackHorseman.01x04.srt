00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,870
<b>1x04 - Zoes and Zeldas</b>

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,551
And he says... he says,
"Why the long face?"

3
00:00:08,635 --> 00:00:13,139
And I say, "Hey, buddy, I can't help it."

4
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:15,850
You get that? Long face.
Horses have long faces.

5
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,394
I am a horse, my face is
long. You get it, right?

6
00:00:18,478 --> 00:00:20,020
Good, good.

7
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:21,272
What about the Rock Hudson stuff?

8
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,608
Felt like that flew over your heads.
Did you get that?

9
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,276
Keep this up, and the
only thing we're gonna get

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,527
is our money back!

11
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,572
Okay, okay, it wasn't that funny.

12
00:00:29,656 --> 00:00:31,783
Maybe you didn't get it.

13
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,326
Uh, hey, guys, guys...

14
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,335
- Hey, let me buy you a drink.
- Get cancer, jerk wad.

15
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:44,337
You've got some good
material, you really do.

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,921
The Gorbachev stuff, it's killer.

17
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:48,966
But you gotta stop asking
people if they get things.

18
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,178
- But then who do I know if they got it?
- They'll laugh.

19
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:55,139
Why are you giving me advice?

20
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,433
Look, I've been doing
stand-up for a year now,

21
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:00,269
and it's the responsibility
of big shots like me

22
00:01:00,353 --> 00:01:02,647
to always be looking
out for the little guy.

23
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,274
- Let me buy you a drink.
- Oh, I don't drink.

24
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:08,611
- BoJack Horseman.
- Herb Kazazz.

25
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:12,824
Oh, God!

26
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:15,576
Goddamn it, Todd, clean up your shit.

27
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,994
What am I supposed to do, okay?

28
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,788
You don't give me any closet space.

29
00:01:18,872 --> 00:01:21,916
Not my problem. A better man
than you once said, and I quote,

30
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,835
"It's the responsibility
of little guys like you

31
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,795
to be looking out for big shots like me."

32
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:27,547
Who said that?

33
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,841
I don't know, Jesus,
Ghandi, Malcolm-Jamal Warner.

34
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:32,886
Clean up your shit! Oh!

35

Hey, BoJack, settle a bet.

41
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:49,503
- Are you a Zoe or a Zelda?
- Don't know what that means.

42
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:50,797
Well, I was talking to Wayne.

43
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,590
- Who's Wayne?
- I'm Wayne.

44
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,050
Wayne's writing an article
about me for BuzzFeed.

45
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:57,845
BuzzFeed?
What'll they think of next?

46
00:02:57,929 --> 00:03:00,848
Fun fact: Wayne is also my ex-boyfriend.

47
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:02,182
You're funny.

48
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:03,810
<i> Pretty cool, eh, BoJack?</i>

49
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,478
Diane's writing a book about you,

50
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:08,815
Wayne's writing an article about me.
We're the same!

51
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:10,441
How could you think that that's the same?

52
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,610
My book will be in libraries
for hundreds of years.

53
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,361
Your BuzzFeed article will be crammed

54
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:16,739
between an animated GIF
of a cat falling asleep

55
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:18,866
and a list of fun facts
about Legally Blonde.

56
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,328
- Ha! Classic Zoe.
- I still don't know what that means.

57
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,830
Well, are you familiar with
Mr. Peanutbutter's House?

58
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:26,290
Do you mean his sitcom that coincidentally

59
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,751
had the exact same premise as my sitcom?

60
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:31,712
Not the exact same.
Mr. Peanutbutter's House

61
00:03:31,796 --> 00:03:34,007
featured a pair of twins, Zoe and Zelda.

62
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,843
<i>Zelda was the sunny, fun-loving extrovert.</i>

63
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:40,429
- Look at my pumpkin, Mr. Peanutbutter.
- Pretty smile, Zelly-belly.

64
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:42,431
Aww...

65
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:44,183
Whereas Zoe was the
smart, cynical introvert.

66
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:47,613
My pumpkin's throwing up because
Halloween encourages excessive

67
00:03:47,614 --> 00:03:51,273
consumption of refined sugar at a
time when obesity rates are sky high.

68
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:55,235
Plus, Halloween costumes are
a gateway to casual racism.

69
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,279
Why don't I keep the knife, Zo-bo?

70
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:58,531
<i>♪ Who's that dog? ♪</i>

71
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,157

<i>♪ Knick-knack, paddywhack
Give a dog a bone ♪</i>

73
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:05,538
Now, was the show's acting ham-fisted
and the writing moronic?

74
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:10,501
- N-n-no?
- Yes, but the Zoe/Zelda paradigm rang true.

75
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,004
I believe everyone's
either a Zoe or a Zelda.

76
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:17,174
For example, Nixon was a
Zoe and Kennedy, a Zelda.

77
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,260
Al Gore, Zoe.
George W. Bush, total Zelda.

78
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:23,848
It's R2-D2 and C-3PO,
Zooey and Emily Deschanel.

79
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,307
So Zooey's a Zoe?

80
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:28,061
No, Zooey's a Zelda.
Emily's the Zoe.

81
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,478
What a crazy world.

82
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:33,232
- So which one are you, BoJack?
- I think I'm... above this.

83
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,775
Said the Zoe.

84
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,695
Well, I think I'm a Zelda.

85
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,488
Or maybe you're the third kind of person,

86
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:41,866
whose only function is to
drain the energy and life force

87
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,744
- from his host organism.
- Come on, BoJack.

88
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:46,579
Nah, he's right.
I'm pretty much worthless.

89
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,455
See? You say something
to someone enough times,

90
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:49,999
and eventually, he internalizes it.

91
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,834
The system works.

92
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:54,087
I don't have a job, I
don't have any prospects.

93
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,381
I probably won't ever finish
the rock opera I'm working on.

94
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,758
What?

95
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:02,136
Since when are you working on a rock opera?

96
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,971
Oh, no. Why'd I ask that?

97
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:07,182
Basically, it's Tommy by
way of Cirque du Soleil

98
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,977
set in space,
with heavy erotic overtones,

99
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:12,063
and the gripping psychodrama of a thriller

100
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:15,399
with plenty of heart and
more than a little humor.

101
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:19,070
I call it Newtopia Rising, Book 1:

102
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:22,907
- The Search for a New Utopia.
- Book 1?

103
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,825

120

That was...
and I don't say this lightly...

121
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:29,932
worse than a hundred September 11ths.

122
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:32,601
Yeah, you're right.
This was stupid.

123
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:34,103
I don't know what I was thinking.

124
00:06:34,187 --> 00:06:37,231
- Well, guess I'll give up forever.
- That's the spirit.

125
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:43,070
Now, you have to understand
that as a port city,

126
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:46,866
Liverpool had unique access to
all aspects of American culture,

127
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,952
especially Blues music and its
unruly nephew, Rock and Roll.

128
00:06:50,036 --> 00:06:52,212
I thought this story was about
running into Paul McCartney

129
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:53,664
in the bathroom at the Golden Globes.

130
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,709
It is. I thought you would
appreciate some context.

131
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,335
Let's skip that one for a minute.

132
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,338
- Tell me about Todd.
- Todd? What's to tell?

133
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,086
Five years ago, he found his way into

134
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:04,842
one of my house parties and never left.

135
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,178
And you've never asked
him anything about himself?

136
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,263
I've asked him to get a job,
I've asked him to move out.

137
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,183
With a little encouragement,
I'll bet he could really flourish.

138
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,684
I mean, didn't you have
anyone who helped you

139
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,229
- when you were just starting out?
- Um, actually, no.

140
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,189
Todd clearly thinks the world of you.

141
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,024
Todd thinks the world of Pop-Tarts.

142
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:23,069
Look, I get that helping other
people is not your thing, but...

143
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:25,487
What? I let Todd live
rent-free in my stately manse.

144
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:27,406
I am his own personal Mother Teresa.

145
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,575
But do you let him stay
here because you're kind

146
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,535
or just because you're
terrified of being alone?

147
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,495
 That is insane!

148
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:36,999
I would love to be alone.
That is all I want.

149
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,001
Mmm... if that were really true,

150
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:40,961
I don't think you'd be clipping
Todd's wings all the time.

151
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:42,504
What? That's unbelievable.

152
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:45,258
- Todd!
- What? Clean up my shit?

153
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,385
Yes, but also, I would like to...

154
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,345
help you with your dumb-ass rock opera.

155
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:54,183
- What?
- I am... supporting you.

156
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:57,144
I-I don't understand.
Oh, my God, are you dying?

157
00:07:57,228 --> 00:08:00,778
No. I... think you have
great depth of untapped

158
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:04,401
potential and I wish to
mentor you in your... art.

159
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,153
- Really?
- Yes.

160
00:08:06,237 --> 00:08:08,614
Wait, is this going to be like that time

161
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,074
you promised to take me ice skating,

162
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,034
and I got really excited
about the ice skating,

163
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:14,078
but then instead of ice
skating, you left me at home

164
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,495
so you could go to the strip club

165
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,706
and then you took the
strippers ice skating?

166
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,917
- No.
- Then hooray!

167
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,797
Let's dig in. Where to start?

168
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,840
Okay, well, the headline is, I hate it.

169
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,425
I hate everything about it.

170
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,469
The premise is bad and
the execution is also bad.

171
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,554
It's an irredeemable jumble of shit.

172
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:35,057
- Tough but fair.
- Ahem.

173
00:08:35,141 --> 00:08:38,894
That said, I don't see why we can't
make something really great here.

174
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:41,438
Okay, thank you. I'll work on that.

175
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:45,025
- Are you close?
- No!

176
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:46,235
- How 'bout now?
- No!

177
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:48,779
- Now?
- You're not even inside of me.

178
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,282
Oh, God!

179
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,658
Did you get there?

180
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,522
Okay, so you know in the
second act closer when the

181
00:08:56,523 --> 00:08:58,747
seekers of Newtopia are
in the Turbidians' dungeon

182
00:08:58,831 --> 00:08:59,915
and they learn their ship

183
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:01,541
- has been destroyed?
- No.

184
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,419
Well, what if we move
that to the fourth act?

185
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:07,214
I have no idea what you're talking
about, but that idea is terrible.

186
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:09,300
I hear the note.
Let me see what I can do.

187
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:15,055
♪ And that's why this planet ♪

188
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:20,144
♪ su-u-u-u-u-cks ♪

189
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,688
- So?
- How can I put this?

190
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,857
Imagine if the Holocaust happened

191
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,026
every four years like the Olympics.

192
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:30,321
I would rather that happened
than your rock opera.

193
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,572
That's not really a note.

194
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:35,534
In fact, none of your
notes have been notes.

195
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,203
I feel like you're not even listening.

196
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:38,912
Yeah, well, you know what?
Maybe I would listen

197
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,747
if the Turbidians had some reason

198
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,479
to enter the Cave of Swollen Dreams that

199
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,210
didn't break the pact
they made in act one

200
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:47,046
- with Queen Darneesa.
- You have been listening.

201
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,339
This just doesn't make sense.

202
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,007
The Turbidians are a loyal people.

203
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:54,845
They... they wouldn't
betray their queen. Unless...

204
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,973
<i>They were working
for Queen Darneesa,</i>

205
00:09:58,057 --> 00:10:00,434
<i>who gave them a potion
that would counteract</i>

206
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,602
<i>the effects of the Elixir
of Failed Remembrance</i>

207
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:05,033
<i>so they could bring the
secret knowledge from</i>

208
00:10:05,034 --> 00:10:07,482
<i>the cave back to her, and
then establish Newtopia</i>

209
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,277
<i>as a vassal state to the Craterman kingdom!</i>

210
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:13,406
Well, don't just sit there!
Get this down!

211
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:16,116
Oh, you like that.

212
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,994
- You like daddy's good stuff?
- Not especially.

213
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,956
Did you get there?

214
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,378
Okay, what if there isn't a robot army?

215
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:30,047
I think you just blew this thing wide open.

216
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:37,763
♪ We'll make this
our Newtopia-a-a ♪

217
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,348
- # Up a fifth #
- # Ah #

218
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:43,185
- # Down a fifth # 
- # A-a-ah #

219
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:45,229
That was great!
This train is moving.

220
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,064
Let's take a break and get lunch.

221
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:51,068
- Wait, you want to get lunch with me?
- Yeah, that's right.

222
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,487
Is this like the time
you invited me to lunch,

223
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,697
but then, when I got to the restaurant,

224
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:58,033
you texted me to tell me you weren't coming

225
00:10:58,117 --> 00:11:02,371
because you were at a strip
club "eating stripper" for lunch,

226
00:11:02,455 --> 00:11:05,749
- and also, it was my birthday?
- No.

227
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,501
Then hooray!

228
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:13,215
And that was a last time I
worked with David O. Russell.

229
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:14,800
What's that old expression?

230
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:18,095
"Fool me once, shame on
me, but fool me twice...

231
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,388
fiddle-dee-dee."

232
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:21,556
I do believe that is the expression.

233
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,725
Ooh, hold on.
I gotta take this.

234
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:25,144
Erica, I don't have time

235
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,562
<i>to be charmed to death right now.</i>

236
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:30,357
So how long have you been
dating Mr. Peanutbutter?

237
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:32,859
Is it serious? I'm only
asking for the article.

238
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:35,779
Better question: How long does it
take to write a BuzzFeed article?

239
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,008
- I want to be thorough.
- What?!

240
00:11:38,043 --> 00:11:39,450
Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane!

241
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,285
- Do you know what today is?
- Sunday?

242
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:45,289
It's "burritos as big as your
head" day at El Taco Loco!

243
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,915
We gotta go right now!

244
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:48,417
I thought we were going
to see the Diane Arbus show

245
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:50,585
at LACMA today. You
know I love Diane Arbus.

246
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,464
I see what's happening here.

247
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:57,717
Her name is Diane,
and your name is Diane.

248
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:59,136
That's not what's happening.

249
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,471
I can go to the Arbus
show with you, Diane.

250
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,598
- What?
- I've actually been meaning to go myself.

251
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:05,767
Oh, man, you guys are
perfect for each other.

252
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,602
Why did you ever break up?

253
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,064
Okay, less yakking, more snacking.

254
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:14,818
Let's go ride in the car!

255
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,236
Here's your steak.

256
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,114
- Uh, sorry.
- Mm-hmm.

257
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:22,372
You mean to tell me that for
a full year you were on the run

258
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:25,912
- from the Russian mafia?
- Well, a Russian mafia.

259
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,831
I can't believe you never
told me any of this stuff.

260
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,416
I just thought you
were a dumb freeloader

261
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,293
who ate all my food and
played video games all day.

262
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:33,504
You should have seen me in high school.

263
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,840
- There was this one game, Decapathon.
- I remember that game.

264
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,176
I was up for Dr. Decapitator
in the movie version.

265
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,635
They said they wanted someone hipper,

266
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,262
but the part ended up
going to Robert Downey.

267
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:43,847
- Junior?
- If it was Junior,

268
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,516
I would have said, "Junior."

269
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,352
That game basically destroyed my life.

270
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,687
<i>I flunked out of school,
my girlfriend left me.</i>

271
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,523
<i>I mean, I didn't stop playing</i>

272
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,401
<i>until my mom threw me out of the house.</i>

273
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:58,445
<i>I mean, that's when I
first realized, you know,</i>

274
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:01,865
- I'm a total screw-up.
- You're not a screw-up anymore, Todd.

275
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,743
You're about to have a hit
rock opera on your hands.

276
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,995
I'm really glad you think that.

277
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,622
I got Princess Carolyn
to invite Virgil Van Cleef

278
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,626
- to our next rehearsal.
- Who in the what Van?

279
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,670
Virgil Van Cleef is the
biggest name in rock opera.

280
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,839
Okay, think of all the great rock operas

281
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:21,635
- from the last 20 years.
- Okay.

282
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,637
He had a piece of all of them.

283
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,680
Wow, Todd, are you sure
we're ready for that?

284
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,558
Hey, you said yourself the train is moving,

285
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,185
but if you think we're not ready,
I mean, I'll listen to you.

286
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:31,978
Hey, you've done enough listening, buddy.

287
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,897
Maybe it's about time I start listening.

288
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,274
Well, I feel like...

289
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,567
Gotta take this. Hello?

290
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,860
Hello?
BoJack Horseman?

291
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:40,946
We have some very
delicate pictures you might

292
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,365
have an interest in not
getting into the wrong hands.

293
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:44,866
I am very happy with my current

294
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,536
- long distance provider, thank you.
- What?

295
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,330
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm
having lunch with my friend.

296
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:52,374
<i>But if you just listen...</i>

297
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,337
All right, gang, when Virgil
Van Cleef gets here, look alive.

298
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:59,172
This could be Todd's big break,

299
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:01,716
so clap really hard and
laugh at all the jokes,

300
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,677
even if they're not funny,
but also, be careful,

301
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,554
because a lot of things
you might think are jokes

302
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:08,181
are not jokes,
so, you know, look out.

303
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,227
- That was not a joke.
- That was not a real laugh.

304
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:14,104
I hope you don't mind
I brought Wayne along.

305
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,814
- Who's Wayne?
- I'm Wayne.

306
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,524
I just wanted to make sure
he had everything he needs

307
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:20,026
for the big BuzzFeed cover story.

308
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,028
BuzzFeed is a website.
There is no cover.

309
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:23,447
Eh, "tomato," "tomato."

310
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,698
It's "tomato," "to-mah-to."

311
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,867
You say, "tomato," "to-mah-to,"
I say, "tomato," "tomato."

312
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:31,163
Oh, hey, Diane, I got you something.

313
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:34,916
- Oh, plane tickets?
- Yep, to San Francisco.

314
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,002
That's where the Arbus
exhibit is heading next.

315
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,088
Oh, my God.
Thanks, Mr. Peanutbutter.

316
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:46,303
Gentlemen, dazzle me.

317
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,639
What you're about to
see is rough, very rough.

318
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,224
It's a vomit pass at what
might become a rock opera.

319
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,935
Right now, it's set mostly in space,
but we're not married to that.

320
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,605
Todd is neither a singer
nor a trained musician.

321
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:58,315
In fact, he never even
graduated high school,

322
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,941
he told me in confidence.

323
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:02,194
Keep all that in mind as
you give it up for Todd.

324
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:08,908
Okay, so we start in 1887

325
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,411
with a young Emma Goldman.

326
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:19,169
♪ No they couldn-n-n-n't
make u-u-u-us ♪

327
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:24,007
♪ sla-a-a-a-a-aves ♪

328
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:30,013
- It needs a third act showstopper.
- I had the same note.

329
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,974
But in all, it's spellbinding.

330
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:35,977
- All right!
- Whoo!

331
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,104
You know, I run a small
theater in North Hollywood.

332
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:41,191
We were supposed to mount
a J.C. Superstar revival

333
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,801
next month, but of
course, Andrew Lloyd Webber

334
00:15:43,802 --> 00:15:46,112
has to be a real hot
penis about everything.

335
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,948
Oh, Andy.
Fool me once, shame on you,

336
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,409
but teach a man to fool me,

337
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,911
and I'll be fooled for the rest of my life.

338
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:56,164
Anyway, could this show be
ready to debut in six weeks?

339
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:59,710
Six weeks?
Uh, damn. Yeah, I guess so.

340
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:03,505
Marvelous! We'll schedule an
investor showcase posthaste.

341
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:05,632
In the meantime, libations!

342
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:07,926
Ah!

343
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,678
<i>- Popping, what?
- This is great.</i>

344
00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:11,722
You know, just when you think
you have a person pegged,

345
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,932
he can still find ways to surprise you.

346
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,309
Yeah, Todd really rose to
the occasion, didn't he?

347
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:19,354
- I was talking about you.
- Ah, well, it was nothing.

348
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:21,940
Maybe the Zoe has a little
Zelda in him after all.

349
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,859
I appreciate the sentiment,
but I still think that game is stupid.

350
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:27,153
Hey, BoJack, do you
realize what this means?

351
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:30,365
I mean, if this thing's a
hit, I could finally move out.

352
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:32,785
Oh, uh, you're gonna move out?

353
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,531
You won't have to yell, "Hey,
Todd, clean up your shit!"

354
00:16:35,566 --> 00:16:37,956
Or, "Todd, why haven't you
cleaned up your shit yet?"

355
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,959
Or, "Todd, what was the name of
that guy from Perfect Strangers?

356
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,587
Not Bronson Pinchot,
but the other one?"

357
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,757
Good, that's great.
That's great and good.

358
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,883
So good, so great.

359
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,970
- Just great, and also good.
- Mm-hmm.

360
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,312
And as you can see,
progress has been swift.

361
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:01,980
For tomorrow's investor showcase,

362
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:05,317
we'll have choreography
and pyrotechnics for you.

363
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,193
This is all just happening so fast.

364
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:09,446
<i>I don't... I don't think
Todd is ready for this.</i>

365
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,740
Todd's not ready or you're not ready?

366
00:17:11,824 --> 00:17:13,992
Don't make this about me.
I've seen what happens

367
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,745
when baby birds get pushed
out of the nest too soon.

368
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:18,789
It's not your fault.

369
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,625
I thought he was ready.
He seemed ready.

370
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:25,545
It's not... your... fault.

371
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:27,255
You're right. In these heady times,

372
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,966
what Todd needs is an agent.
Ha! Ha!

373
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,926
- I just need you to deliver...
- Hoo! Ha!

374
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,095
- That third act showstopper...
- Ha!

375
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,348
... and then we'll be fully financed!

376
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:39,518
Todd can do it!
Todd can do anything!

377
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:40,769
- Can I get your autograph?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

378
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:42,020
And another autograph,

379
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,689
and initial here, here, here, and here.

380
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:44,939
- Right here?
- And the last four digits

381
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:46,525
- of your social.
- Okay.

382
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:50,320
So I think the big third
act number Virgil wants

383
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,490
- might be a big anthem that...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy, buddy,

384
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,701
I'm not gonna let you start
on this until we stock up

385
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:57,202
on snacks and Red Bull.

386
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:00,997
I do get snacky.
You think of everything.

387
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,544
'Scuse me, young man.

388
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:07,796
Can you hand me that
Ronnie Milsap cassingle

389
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,884
- in the 10-cent bin?
- Sure thing, lady.

390
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:17,931
Oh, my God. Decapathon VII?
This just came out.

391
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:21,226
- Todd, put it down.
- Is this really only a dime?

392
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,269
If it's in there, that's the price.

393
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,856
Todd, this is no time for a relapse.

394
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,441
Look, okay, I'll buy it
now, but I won't play it

395
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,652
till after I've written the new song.

396
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:32,863
Todd, this is a bad idea!

397
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,156
- Whoa!
- All sales are final.

398
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,953
Okay, let's see here.

399
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,288
I wonder if it still smells the same.

400
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,917
I assure you, it still smells
like cheap plastic and child labor.

401
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:48,211
Okay, here we go. Song time.

402
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,673
Or should I just play one game now,

403
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:53,967
just to get the creative juices flowing?

404
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,802
We both know that if you
play that game tonight,

405
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:57,637
you'll never leave this couch!

406
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:59,765
Ah, no, you're right, of course.

407
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:03,184
- Thank you.
- Good night.

408
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,106
Come on, Decapathon, come on.

409
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:11,150
<i>Oh, come on, Decapathon.</i>

410
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,445
Oh.

411
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:16,573
Wake up! It's the morning!

412
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:20,034
Damn it, Todd, the investor
showcase is in half an hour.

413
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:21,870
- Did you work on the song?
- Huh?

414
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:24,205
Pull yourself together, man!

415
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:27,793
Ugh! Why did the water have
to come out of your mouth?

416
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:31,671
Well, I'm awfully sorry
to have wasted your time.

417
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:34,257
I don't think our man is going to show.

418
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,969
<i>Wait!</i>

419
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,637
Good God, what's happened?

420
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,807
He looks like he was up all
night playing some sort of

421
00:19:41,808 --> 00:19:44,893
videographic game. He's in
no condition to debut a song.

422
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:47,520
Give the kid a chance, Van Cleef.

429

- Enough!
- Clearly, Van Cleef has shown

430
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,637
a rare lapse in taste and judgment.

431
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,016
I apologize for wasting your
time with this talentless imp.

432
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,810
Hey, Van Cleef, Todd may not be ready

433
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,187
for the high-flying world of rock opera

434
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,148
or the larger world outside
of my living room couch,

435
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,860
but you know what?
He's a good friend.

436
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,778
I don't see how that's relevant.

437
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:39,238
No, of course you don't.
Maybe Todd's worse off today,

438
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:41,951
but you're worse off in
the long run, because you're

439
00:20:41,952 --> 00:20:44,828
gonna die alone and unloved,
you pompous, affected asshole!

440
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:48,748
Mon dieu!
Never have I ever!

441
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:51,001
Hey, maybe don't burn the bridge.

442
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:54,671
- I could still beg for a second chance.
- Shut your mouth, Todd.

443
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,382
And you shut yours, Van Cleef,
or I will buck it shut.

444
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:00,385
Suck a dick, dumb shits!

445
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:05,557
Oh, that damn video game.

446
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,185
No, it's not the video game's fault.
I blew it.

447
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,479
For a second, I actually convinced myself

448
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:14,024
I was more than just a worthless screw-up.

449
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,225
Fool me once, fool me twice,

450
00:21:16,226 --> 00:21:18,570
fool me chicken soup with rice.

451
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:21,489
I guess there's a reason they
don't call it "the rock opera fun."

452
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:23,867
They call it "the rock opera business."

453
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,203
 Guess I won't be needing
this piece of junk anymore.

454
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,622
Hey, no. Hold on to that.

455
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,165
Why don't you just put it
in the living room closet?

456
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:33,543
- Really?
- In fact, from now on,

457
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,503
you can keep all your stuff
in the living room closet.

458
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:41,342
- Thanks, BoJack, for everything.
- This, I will get rid of.

459
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:45,805
- What the...
- Don't look at those!

460
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:47,974
- Those are private!
- Are these the notes

461
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:51,103
you've been taking on
Mr. Peanutbutter? It's gibberish!

462
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,730
Have you just been mashing
keys this whole time?

463
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,065
It's a... it's a work in progress.

464
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,191
What's really going on here?

465
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:59,695
Look, I've been following
you two around for the

466
00:21:59,696 --> 00:22:02,114
last couple weeks, and I
think it's pretty obvious

467
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:04,616
to everyone that you shouldn't
be with Mr. Peanutbutter.

468
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:08,120
- You should be with me.
- No, I've dated you.

469
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:12,082
Sure, you're smart and
sophisticated and cool,

470
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:13,750
but you're also mean.

471
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,252
What's your article on
Mr. Peanutbutter called?

472
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,588
The working title is,
"Nine Jokes From the '90s

473
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:19,965
We Haven't Stopped Laughing at."

474
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:21,674
- I knew it!
- Come on!

475
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:24,052
Like you're not gonna tear
BoJack apart in your book.

476
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:26,512
I'm not "tearing him apart."

477
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:29,808
I'm writing a nuanced
portrait of a complicated man.

478
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:32,518
Well, then, we might be
doing different things.

479
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:34,854
Mr. Peanutbutter is nice to me!

480
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:38,524
He's kind and he's generous
and he's loyal.

481
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:41,402
You know what your
problem is? You're trying

482
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:44,072
to be a Zelda but you're
so obviously a Zoe.

483
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:46,282
Don't label me.
You don't know who I am.

484
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,911
You can live your happy Zelda
life in this happy Zelda town

485
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:52,205
and pretend you're a happy Zelda,

486
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:56,375
but I know you, and this isn't you.

487
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,670
<i>People don't change, Diane, not really.</i>

488
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,213
<i>Mr. Peanutbutter's a Zelda.</i>

489
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:01,840
<i>He's happy and he's carefree</i>

490
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:05,718
<i>and he's loving, but
you and me, we're Zoes.</i>

491
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:09,055
Yeah, I bought this earlier,
and I'd like to return it.

492
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:10,556
I don't know where the receipt went.

493
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:12,892
I remember you.
You came in yesterday.

494
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:15,228
No problem.

495
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,105
<i>We're Zoes, Diane.</i>

496
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:20,025
<i>We're cynical and we're
sad and we're mean.</i>

497
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:24,237
Thanks for your help, character
actress Margo Martindale.

498
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,199
I don't feel good about
what we did here, BoJack.

499
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:31,703
I don't know what you're talking about.
This never happened.

500
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:34,664
<i>There's a darkness inside you,</i>

501
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:38,334
and you can bury it deep in
burritos as big as your head,

502
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,171
but someday soon, that
darkness is gonna come out,

503
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:44,590
and when it does, I want you to call me.

504
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:49,345
I like that guy.
