1
00:00:10,612 --> 00:00:12,254
Slow down, Henrietta.

2
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,114
A lady mustn't rush. It's unbecoming.

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,434
I am not Henrietta! I'm your son!

4
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,853
My son is a ball of gas.

5
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,084
Yes! Your son, BoJack. I'm him.

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,612
I'm the ball of gas!

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,026
But you're also a star.

8
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,605
Wait. Mom, do you remember...

9
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,197
Shh! Henrietta, I am talking to the sun.

10
00:00:30,203 --> 00:00:32,138
Sun, you're a ball of gas,

11
00:00:32,144 --> 00:00:34,004
but you're also a star.

12
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,745
- We call you... "Sun."
- Ugh!

13
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:39,414
Where are you taking me?
Are we going to the lake house?

14
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:42,834
No, we're going to a
glorious magical place

15
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:45,254
where they'll lock you
in a room by yourself

16
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,256
so you can't hurt anyone ever again.

17
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:50,050
Oh, that sounds lovely.
Why are you driving so slowly?

18
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,677
- Hurry up!
- Wait. You just said...

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,535
Time's arrow neither stands

20
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:55,644
still nor reverses, after all.

21
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,775
It merely marches forward.

22
00:00:57,781 --> 00:01:00,148
Isn't that right, Henrietta?

23
00:01:00,154 --> 00:01:02,364
Yes, Mrs. Horseman. That's right.

24
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,484
Well, here we are.

25
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,039
- Here?
- Yes.

26
00:01:11,165 --> 00:01:12,417
Ugh!

27

28
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,400
Halt! No entry.

29
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,944
- But I wanna slide.
- This is no mere slide.

30
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,447
We three are members of an elite society

31
00:02:35,453 --> 00:02:37,151
of extremely young women,

32
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,666
led by I,

33
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:41,075
Miss Clemelia Bloodsworth.

34
00:02:41,153 --> 00:02:42,571
You may not enter.

35
00:02:42,655 --> 00:02:44,990
- Yeah, and also you're fat.
- Oh!

36
00:02:45,074 --> 00:02:46,909
I'm not fat.

37
00:02:46,992 --> 00:02:48,828
Even your lungs expostulate

38
00:02:48,911 --> 00:02:51,414
as they struggle to expel
your ample corpulence.

39
00:02:51,497 --> 00:02:54,166
She's saying your lungs
think you're fat too.

40
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,961
Father says I'm just growing.

41
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,390
If you do not halt, we will be forced

42
00:02:58,396 --> 00:03:00,828
to physically impede your egress.

43
00:03:01,173 --> 00:03:04,135
Ow! Ow! You're hurting me! Ow!

44
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,438
Beatrice, stop reading
and put on your uniform.

45
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:18,065
Father, I don't feel well.

46
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:19,464
I don't care if you're scared of

47
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,031
Clemelia Bloodsworth and her gaggle,

48
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,611
you have to go to school.

49
00:03:22,695 --> 00:03:24,780
Now stop making books your friends.

50
00:03:24,864 --> 00:03:27,450
Reading does nothing for young
women but build their brains,

51
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:29,243
taking valuable resources away

52
00:03:29,249 --> 00:03:30,958
from their breasts and hips.

53
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:33,967
- But my throat hurts.
- Uniform! Now!

54
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,628
Beatrice? Oh, my, you're hot.

55
00:03:39,837 --> 00:03:41,046
Dear Lord.

56
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:46,072
Now listen here, it's a

57
00:03:46,078 --> 00:03:48,184
mother's duty to keep her children alive

58
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:49,972
and you are continually failing!

59
00:03:50,055 --> 00:03:53,225
How could you not have known
she has scarlet fever?

60
00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:55,895
Say something, damn it!
What has become of you?

61
00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:58,189
I swear if I'd known
this is how you'd behave

62
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:01,066
once we severed the connections
to your prefrontal cortex,

63
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:02,505
I'd hardly have bothered.

64
00:04:02,511 --> 00:04:05,230
- Father?
- Yes, darling?

65
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,376
Am I to die?

66
00:04:06,382 --> 00:04:09,277
Well, eventually yes, but
this illness is but a hiccup

67
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:11,160
in what will be a long and happy life,

68
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,793
- I promise.
- You promise?

69
00:04:12,876 --> 00:04:14,795
In fact, some good may yet come of this.

70
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:17,231
Doctor says your throat
is nearly swollen shut.

71
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,251
So perhaps you'll finally
lose some of that weight

72
00:04:19,335 --> 00:04:20,586
that's given you such troubles.

73
00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:22,917
- Won't that be nice?
- Yes, Father.

74
00:04:26,284 --> 00:04:28,677
- Ow!
- Suck in, Miss Sugarman, please.

75
00:04:28,761 --> 00:04:30,930
Polly, be a darling and
fetch me a pretty pill

76
00:04:31,013 --> 00:04:32,515
and a glass of water, won't you?

77
00:04:32,598 --> 00:04:34,350
Yes, Señorita Sugarman.

78
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:36,644
Beatrice, you're looking
well, which is just fine,

79
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:39,188
because your debutante
party is vitally important.

80
00:04:39,271 --> 00:04:41,857
Will it end poverty, war and injustice,

81
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:44,527
or bring back civil rights
activist Medgar Evers,

82
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,612
who was shot in Mississippi this week?

83
00:04:46,632 --> 00:04:50,109
Yes! Or rather, it will end you
worrying about that nonsense

84
00:04:50,115 --> 00:04:51,617
because it will land you a husband.

85
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,108
At least Evers' death means no one else

86
00:04:54,114 --> 00:04:57,021
will be assassinated this year, 1963.

87
00:04:57,027 --> 00:04:59,229
The FBI is on too high alert to allow

88
00:04:59,235 --> 00:05:01,090
anything like that to happen again.

89
00:05:01,096 --> 00:05:03,265
- Hmm?
- Yes... well...

90
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,202
Your chaperone, Corbin Creamerman,

91
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,793
is a fine young man.

92
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:08,926
Oh, Jeez.

93
00:05:08,932 --> 00:05:10,619
My lady.

94
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,479
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

95
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:16,805
So... uh,

96
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:18,607
you look nice.

97
00:05:18,613 --> 00:05:21,516
Thank you, Corbin. That's the
third time you've told me.

98
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:22,898
You needn't tell me again.

99
00:05:22,982 --> 00:05:24,834
Oh, Jeez. I'm sorry. I'm not

100
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,824
always good at these things.

101
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,536
But sometimes I am. I can be. I...

102
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:29,750
I really try to be.

103
00:05:29,756 --> 00:05:30,996
I'm, well, I... I'm not.

104
00:05:31,002 --> 00:05:32,610
I'm really not. I don't know why.

105
00:05:32,616 --> 00:05:35,494
Ah, that's all right. I'm not either.

106
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,490
Corbin's father, Mort Creamerman,

107
00:05:37,496 --> 00:05:38,911
is founder of Creamerman's

108
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:40,713
Creamy Cream-based Commodities.

109
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,525
Think of all the free
iced cream you could,

110
00:05:42,531 --> 00:05:44,216
uh, serve to other people.

111
00:05:44,222 --> 00:05:47,250
Father, do you aim to marry
me off to Corbin Creamerman

112
00:05:47,256 --> 00:05:49,300
merely because it would
be good for business?

113
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:51,421
Well, I suppose I do have a few ideas

114
00:05:51,427 --> 00:05:54,638
of how a Sugarman/Creamerman
alliance might be advantageous.

115
00:05:54,644 --> 00:05:55,853
- Uh-huh.
- For example,

116
00:05:55,859 --> 00:05:58,736
imagine a television
advertisement with a fun jingle.

117
00:05:58,976 --> 00:06:01,312
♪ Have your morning coffee or tea ♪

118
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:03,063
♪ With Sugarman and Creamerman ♪

119
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:05,190
♪ But save some for... these fellas ♪

120
00:06:05,274 --> 00:06:07,860
And then it's Mort and me, and
we're holding up our products

121
00:06:07,943 --> 00:06:09,805
with big smiles from across a very

122
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:11,619
ordinary looking kitchen table.

123
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:14,908
Father, common Americans
don't want you on their TV sets.

124
00:06:14,992 --> 00:06:18,078
You're a reminder of the disparity
of wealth in this country.

125
00:06:18,084 --> 00:06:20,419
Poor people find that dreadfully gauche.

126
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:23,125
You know, I sent you to
Barnard to get your MRS

127
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,336
from a fine upstanding Columbia man,

128
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:27,254
but instead of a bachelor
you returned home

129
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:30,507
with a bachelor's degree
and a mouth full of sass.

130
00:06:30,513 --> 00:06:32,014
What a waste!

131
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,388
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

132
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:39,159
Oh, my... Beatrice Sugarman?

133
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,305
Doth my eye belie me?

134
00:06:41,311 --> 00:06:43,664
Oh, Clemelia Bloodsworth.

135
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,569
Why are you here?

136
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:47,368
I must say, it's tremendous

137
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:49,031
you're finally debuting.

138
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,654
Better late than never, hmm?

139
00:06:51,737 --> 00:06:53,787
Ugh! I'm only doing this for my father,

140
00:06:53,793 --> 00:06:55,579
who has very old-fashioned ideas

141
00:06:55,658 --> 00:06:57,618
about how a woman is to live her life.

142
00:06:57,701 --> 00:07:00,704
Poor Corbin here is saddled
with chaperoning me.

143
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,033
Oh, I don't feel saddled.

144
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,583
In truth, I find these
parties to be garish,

145
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:06,919
self-serving wastes of money.

146
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:08,291
Oh, and I'm sure yours was

147
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:11,583
particularly horrendous, Clemelia.

148
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:14,884
Oh, my! How repugnant!

149
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:19,780
Uh... Scotch on the rocks.

150
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:22,885
Do I know you?

151
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:24,759
Nope, just crashing some dumb

152
00:07:24,765 --> 00:07:26,402
debutante's party.

153
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,867
Oh, do you mean for "dumb"

154
00:07:28,873 --> 00:07:30,906
to describe the party or the debutante?

155
00:07:30,985 --> 00:07:33,529
Because I might agree with
you, or I might be offended.

156
00:07:33,612 --> 00:07:35,531
You're the dumb debutante, aren't you?

157
00:07:35,614 --> 00:07:38,242
Beatrice Sugarman.
Welcome to my dumb party.

158
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:40,536
Butterscotch Horseman.
Charmed, I'm sure.

159
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:41,829
You crash a lot of these?

160
00:07:41,835 --> 00:07:43,601
I'll take my free alcohol
where I can get it.

161
00:07:43,607 --> 00:07:45,040
Saving for California.

162
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:46,291
What's in California?

163
00:07:46,297 --> 00:07:48,711
Ginsberg, Cassady, Squirrelinghetti.

164
00:07:48,794 --> 00:07:51,630
This is where you ask me if those
are towns, and I smirk at you.

165
00:07:51,714 --> 00:07:53,924
I am familiar with the Beats, thank you.

166
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:56,260
I like Ginsberg all
right, but if you ask me,

167
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,303
that Squirrelinghetti is nuts.

168
00:07:58,387 --> 00:08:00,597
- What's your interest in them?
- What's my interest?

169
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,599
They're the greatest
minds of our generation.

170
00:08:02,605 --> 00:08:04,314
I'm heading west to join them, because

171
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,233
I'm one of the greatest minds too.

172
00:08:06,311 --> 00:08:07,813
- I see.
- You will see.

173
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:09,690
I'm writing the next
Great American Novel.

174
00:08:09,773 --> 00:08:11,525
Oh, what's it about?

175
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:13,360
It's about truth! It's about war!

176
00:08:13,366 --> 00:08:15,086
It's about the twilighting frontier

177
00:08:15,092 --> 00:08:16,827
of the lives that were promised us.

178
00:08:16,905 --> 00:08:19,491
But what is it about?
Who are the characters?

179
00:08:19,575 --> 00:08:21,201
I never claimed to have the whole thing

180
00:08:21,207 --> 00:08:23,709
- sorted out just yet, did I?
- Sounds like a best seller.

181
00:08:23,715 --> 00:08:26,832
You're sarcastic, which is an
ugly thing for a woman to be.

182
00:08:26,915 --> 00:08:29,626
I don't know how you expect to
nab a husband at a party like this

183
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:30,955
with a personality like that.

184
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:32,320
Oh, congratulations.

185
00:08:32,326 --> 00:08:34,803
You and my father express
the same concerns.

186
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:36,310
If I were your old man,

187
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,109
I'd be anxious to get
you married off, too.

188
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:40,471
I bet your thank-you
letters are perfunctory,

189
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:43,140
your flower arrangements are uninspired,

190
00:08:43,146 --> 00:08:45,065
and your curtsy is an embarrassment.

191
00:08:46,435 --> 00:08:48,937
Looks like you pegged me
as well as I pegged you.

192
00:08:49,976 --> 00:08:52,306
What must your mother think of you?

193
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:54,094
Oh, she doesn't think much...

194
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,696
About anything, anymore.

195
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,565
Oh. I'm sorry, did... did she pass?

196
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:00,616
- No, not exactly.
- Mine did.

197
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:02,326
I'm very sorry to hear that.

198
00:09:02,332 --> 00:09:04,501
I was little. I don't remember, really.

199
00:09:04,566 --> 00:09:06,719
But she had a diamond just like yours.

200
00:09:06,725 --> 00:09:08,367
I saw it in a picture once.

201
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:10,997
- Oh...
- Yes, this is my mother.

202
00:09:11,003 --> 00:09:12,540
- What?
- I'd like to leave her here.

203
00:09:12,546 --> 00:09:14,525
Can I pay for the next five years now so

204
00:09:14,531 --> 00:09:16,261
I don't have to think about her again?

205
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,925
- Wha... Oh.
- Oh, jeez, I...

206
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:21,386
I'm sorry to interrupt, but
we have to do the thing now,

207
00:09:21,392 --> 00:09:23,415
where we do the... things.

208
00:09:23,421 --> 00:09:25,590
Oh... oh, right. Um...

209
00:09:25,596 --> 00:09:26,885
Please excuse me.

210
00:09:26,891 --> 00:09:29,399
Of course, it sounds very important.

211
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:31,871
Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Sugarman

212
00:09:31,877 --> 00:09:33,309
present their daughter,

213
00:09:33,315 --> 00:09:35,818
Miss Beatrice Elizabeth Sugarman.

214
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:38,946
Chaperoned by Mr. Corbin C. Creamerman.

215
00:09:40,823 --> 00:09:42,116
Look at her go, folks.

216
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:44,159
Clearing every hurdle.

217
00:09:44,165 --> 00:09:45,708
Look at that form.

218
00:09:45,714 --> 00:09:47,591
What precise movements.

219
00:09:47,597 --> 00:09:49,564
- Five, six...
- Beautiful trot.

220
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,072
Truly outstanding.

221
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,252
A lovely lady indeed.

222
00:09:53,335 --> 00:09:55,838
Ta-da!

223
00:09:55,844 --> 00:09:58,013
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

224
00:09:58,019 --> 00:09:59,020
Oh...

225
00:10:01,303 --> 00:10:04,166
Excuse me. Don't you
know it's rude to leave

226
00:10:04,172 --> 00:10:05,736
without saying goodbye to the hostess?

227
00:10:05,742 --> 00:10:07,000
Why don't you come with me?

228
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,662
It'll dispense with the
need for goodbyes,

229
00:10:08,668 --> 00:10:10,429
thus eliminating my transgression.

230
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:12,291
Oh! You want me to leave

231
00:10:12,297 --> 00:10:14,153
my own party with you?

232
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:16,441
The low-life who wasn't even invited?

233
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,979
Yeah.

234
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:20,505
But I suppose Daddy
wouldn't like that, would he?

235
00:10:26,395 --> 00:10:28,106
Oh, Beatrice.

236
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,725
_

237
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:35,127
- I have wonderful news.
- I'm reading.

238
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,941
Corbin Creamerman has come to call.

239
00:10:36,947 --> 00:10:38,635
He'd like to take you
for a Sunday stroll.

240
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:41,310
I am not interested
in Corbin Creamerman.

241
00:10:41,316 --> 00:10:44,011
I don't give a damn
where your interests lie!

242
00:10:44,094 --> 00:10:46,847
After the disappearing act you
pulled at your own party,

243
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,683
you're lucky I don't fill
a jar with jellied beans

244
00:10:49,766 --> 00:10:51,222
and marry you off to the man who

245
00:10:51,228 --> 00:10:53,706
- can closest estimate the amount.
- Heavens!

246
00:10:53,712 --> 00:10:56,607
Corbin Creamerman is willing
to give you a second chance,

247
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,359
he is downstairs waiting,
and you will be civil to him.

248
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:03,238
And the way they make non-dairy creamer

249
00:11:03,322 --> 00:11:06,617
is by replacing the milk
fat with vegetable oil.

250
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,660
That's why it doesn't
need refrigeration.

251
00:11:08,744 --> 00:11:10,954
- Pretty nifty, huh?
- Is that so?

252
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:12,598
Oh, jeez, I'm boring you.

253
00:11:12,604 --> 00:11:14,546
Not at all. I don't find you boring.

254
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,376
Only the things you
choose to talk about,

255
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,128
and the way in which
you talk about them.

256
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,161
Oh, I... I'm sorry. I... I just

257
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:22,179
get excited by food chemistry.

258
00:11:22,257 --> 00:11:24,217
You know, you take something
you thought you knew,

259
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:26,261
and then discover there's
so much more to it

260
00:11:26,267 --> 00:11:28,726
than you could have
possibly imagined. It's like...

261
00:11:29,117 --> 00:11:30,635
- Magic.
- Oh?

262
00:11:30,641 --> 00:11:32,476
My father is less enchanted.

263
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,479
He says it's just squeezing
money out of cow teats.

264
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:38,231
I suppose that's true,
but I got ideas too,

265
00:11:38,237 --> 00:11:40,244
and I feel I never get to be anything

266
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,404
other than what he expects me to be.

267
00:11:42,653 --> 00:11:44,529
You know what that's like?

268
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:45,828
I do.

269
00:11:45,989 --> 00:11:47,240
You know, Corbin,

270
00:11:47,245 --> 00:11:50,331
it occurs to me that perhaps
you and I aren't so...

271
00:11:50,337 --> 00:11:51,922
Oh, dear!

272
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,962
Nice gams.

273
00:12:03,968 --> 00:12:05,258
Nice gams.

274
00:12:05,264 --> 00:12:07,725
Is that the only thing
you can think of to say?

275
00:12:07,731 --> 00:12:09,093
Nice...

276
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,343
Gams.

277
00:12:11,584 --> 00:12:12,655
Uh...

278
00:12:12,661 --> 00:12:15,044
Beatrice, what are you doing here?

279
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,348
I had to look you up in the phone book.

280
00:12:17,354 --> 00:12:19,248
The number you gave me was to a pizza

281
00:12:19,254 --> 00:12:21,197
parlor in Brownsburg.

282
00:12:21,203 --> 00:12:22,442
What? Are you sure?

283
00:12:22,448 --> 00:12:24,116
Butterscotch, I'm pregnant.

284
00:12:24,122 --> 00:12:25,882
- Wha...
- Whoa, boy!

285
00:12:25,888 --> 00:12:28,073
Come on, Bopper, can you
give us some privacy, please?

286
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,930
Sure thing, Butterscotch.
You take it easy.

287
00:12:31,847 --> 00:12:33,787
Are you certain it's mine?

288
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,455
Well, whose else could it be?

289
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:37,708
What do you wanna do?
Maybe you have a cousin,

290
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,751
who has a... a friend,
who knows a doctor,

291
00:12:39,835 --> 00:12:41,920
who can take care of
such inconveniences?

292
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:44,208
I'm... I'm happy to do the
gentlemanly thing and...

293
00:12:44,214 --> 00:12:45,674
and pay for the cab fare.

294
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,844
No. I can't.

295
00:12:48,927 --> 00:12:51,138
Well, that doesn't leave
us with very many options.

296
00:12:51,144 --> 00:12:52,312
I'm a ruined woman.

297
00:12:52,318 --> 00:12:54,510
Don't be hysterical. You're not ruined.

298
00:12:54,516 --> 00:12:57,023
It's a verifiable fact you
look more beautiful than ever.

299
00:12:57,029 --> 00:12:59,187
Oh, what do you know?

300
00:13:00,272 --> 00:13:02,524
It was a pretty great night
we had together, huh?

301
00:13:02,607 --> 00:13:03,984
It was.

302
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:06,070
Say,

303
00:13:06,545 --> 00:13:07,883
did you ever hear the story of

304
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:09,703
the couple who moved to California?

305
00:13:09,781 --> 00:13:11,241
I can't say that I have.

306
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:12,868
Oh, it's a marvelous adventure.

307
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:14,494
You see, they hardly knew each other,

308
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:16,328
but they shared a certain sensitivity

309
00:13:16,334 --> 00:13:17,753
and a taste for the unknown.

310
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:20,250
They were living in a one-horse
town, so they headed west,

311
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,170
towards a town that could
accommodate three horses.

312
00:13:23,253 --> 00:13:25,839
Oh, yes, I think I
have heard this story.

313
00:13:25,845 --> 00:13:27,833
They got a small house in San Francisco

314
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,181
near the bookstore.

315
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:31,511
He got in good with
Squirrelinghetti and his scurry.

316
00:13:31,595 --> 00:13:33,263
He wrote his Great American Novel...

317
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,348
While his wife took care of the baby.

318
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:37,477
His wife? Oh,

319
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,231
well, I didn't hear about that part.

320
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:41,395
Well, if she'd have him.

321
00:13:41,478 --> 00:13:43,387
If a beautiful creature like herself

322
00:13:43,393 --> 00:13:45,195
could ever love an oaf like him.

323
00:13:45,273 --> 00:13:47,317
- I think she could.
- Yeah?

324
00:13:47,401 --> 00:13:49,523
And isn't that how the story goes?

325
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,157
Come on, come on, come on.

326
00:14:10,163 --> 00:14:11,925
- Sleep.
- The baby's hungry.

327
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:14,011
I tried. He won't eat. I
don't know what he wants.

328
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:15,387
Well, can you figure it out?

329
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,140
If I don't sleep, how can I work
to support you and the child,

330
00:14:18,223 --> 00:14:19,975
let alone have energy
left over to write?

331
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:23,180
Maybe if anyone wanted to pay
you for anything you wrote,

332
00:14:23,186 --> 00:14:25,480
we'd be able to afford
a nanny and a maid.

333
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:28,108
Well, if Squirrelinghetti and
his horde of commie, liberal,

334
00:14:28,191 --> 00:14:30,277
Jew-loving rejects knew
what good writing was,

335
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,653
I'd be able to sell something.

336
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:34,323
Oh, so they're all
wrong, and you're right.

337
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:37,743
Why won't you just

338
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:40,000
take that corner office
job at Sugarman West

339
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:42,748
instead of breaking your
back all day at the cannery,

340
00:14:42,754 --> 00:14:44,343
and then maybe you could afford me some

341
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:46,006
decent help around here?

342
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:48,879
You want me to work for your
father, and get paid for it,

343
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:50,422
like some sort of slave?

344
00:14:50,505 --> 00:14:53,467
- That is the opposite of slavery.
- Is it?

345
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,887
Yes, it is! You have no
facility for language.

346
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:00,140
Oh, will you at long last be quiet?

347
00:15:00,223 --> 00:15:02,392
You wanted that baby. Never forget that.

348
00:15:02,476 --> 00:15:04,644
I need quiet!

349
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,776
You'd better be worth all this.

350
00:15:14,738 --> 00:15:17,157
- Well, you're not.
- I'm not what?

351
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,701
Mommy's tired, BoJack. Tell me a story.

352
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:22,204
Oh, once upon a time...

353
00:15:22,287 --> 00:15:24,081
Quiet. Your father's home.

354
00:15:24,164 --> 00:15:26,319
How was work, darling?

355
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,919
Ugh! Terrible. Those fish
do not like being canned.

356
00:15:29,002 --> 00:15:31,671
Well, I burnt dinner, again.

357
00:15:31,755 --> 00:15:33,882
But you can pick at the charred remains

358
00:15:33,965 --> 00:15:36,093
- and delight me and your simple son
- God.

359
00:15:36,176 --> 00:15:38,845
with stories of your noble,
salt-of-the-earth co-workers

360
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:42,432
like Eight-Finger Joe and
Sports-Team Steve...

361
00:15:42,438 --> 00:15:44,053
- Oh, God.
- ...before locking yourself

362
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:45,790
- in your study for the night...
- Know what?

363
00:15:45,796 --> 00:15:47,783
... to chip away at your never-ending

364
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:49,403
goddamn novel.

365
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:50,690
I'll clean up the kitchen,

366
00:15:50,774 --> 00:15:52,984
- and bathe our filthy child.
- If you could just...

367
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:54,194
And we'll just keep waltzing

368
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,815
- through this goddamn...
- Would you...

369
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,489
- ... proletariat dream.
- No...

370
00:15:57,572 --> 00:16:00,033
Maybe if the goddamn baby
wasn't crying all the time,

371
00:16:00,117 --> 00:16:01,827
I could finish the goddamn novel.

372
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,412
I'm not a baby. I'm six.

373
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,372
Yes, wah, wah, Ga, Ga, goo, goo.

374
00:16:05,455 --> 00:16:06,998
I'm forming sentences.

375
00:16:07,082 --> 00:16:09,126
Oh, and I can't? Everyone's a critic.

376
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:10,502
I can see the headline now,

377
00:16:10,585 --> 00:16:12,281
"Idiot Son Thinks Dad's Book is

378
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,927
"Great, comma, Son is Idiot."

379
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:15,632
I didn't say your book is great.

380
00:16:15,715 --> 00:16:16,883
I can't live like this!

381
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:19,094
I should have married Corbin Creamerman.

382
00:16:19,177 --> 00:16:20,595
Ha! Like he'd have you.

383
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,056
Oh, he would have. And he
would have been kind to me.

384
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,101
And he wouldn't have been
too much of a stubborn ass

385
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:28,812
to take a decent job at
my father's company!

386
00:16:28,895 --> 00:16:30,544
Fine! I'll take the corner office, with

387
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,112
the company car, six-figure salary,

388
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,442
and four weeks paid vacation,

389
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:34,730
but if my novel becomes

390
00:16:34,736 --> 00:16:36,147
bad because I no longer remember

391
00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:37,782
what it's like to be working class,

392
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,369
we'll know of whom to be blamed.

393
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:42,826
Oh.

394
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:45,996
A little to the left. Good choice.

395
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,248
Just over... Careful with that.
That looks great.

396
00:16:48,331 --> 00:16:50,083
Hello? You're always in the way.

397
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:51,412
- Why don't you go play?
- Okay.

398
00:16:51,418 --> 00:16:52,621
- Go do something.
- Bye, Mom.

399
00:16:52,627 --> 00:16:54,296
You are fired. Vacuum. Thank you. Stat.

400
00:16:54,302 --> 00:16:55,678
Goodbye. Thank you.

401
00:16:55,684 --> 00:16:57,562
Henrietta, will you help me pack this?

402
00:16:57,568 --> 00:16:59,044
I want to bring it to my son.

403
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,511
Oh, that's so nice.
I love a good painting.

404
00:17:01,595 --> 00:17:04,235
It's like TV without all
the talking and movement.

405
00:17:04,241 --> 00:17:06,183
Jesus, what is that ghastly thing?

406
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:07,809
It belonged to Father.

407
00:17:08,768 --> 00:17:09,936
I'm giving it to BoJack.

408
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,784
I never cared for the aesthetic arts.

409
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,827
Dulls the senses.

410
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,859
Art should be straightforward
and utilitarian, like my novel.

411
00:17:15,942 --> 00:17:17,027
I can't wait to read it.

412
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,905
Books are fantastic.
The words tell stories.

413
00:17:19,988 --> 00:17:22,866
- Henrietta, the painting.
- Right away, Mrs. Horseman.

414
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:24,659
I shouldn't have to ask you twice.

415
00:17:24,665 --> 00:17:26,125
God gave you two ears

416
00:17:26,131 --> 00:17:28,433
and me only the one mouth, after all.

417
00:17:29,664 --> 00:17:32,709
- You could be nicer to her.
- No one's ever nice to me.

418
00:17:32,715 --> 00:17:34,426
- Why should I be nice?
- Beatrice...

419
00:17:34,432 --> 00:17:37,541
Just because the maid bats
her little eyes at you

420
00:17:37,547 --> 00:17:40,300
and makes barely-qualifying-
for-conversation conversation,

421
00:17:40,383 --> 00:17:42,761
doesn't mean I'm so easily seduced.

422
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:44,778
I don't know what
you're insinuating. I...

423
00:17:44,784 --> 00:17:46,541
Oh, I'm sure she makes you feel like

424
00:17:46,547 --> 00:17:48,438
a big smart man,

425
00:17:48,517 --> 00:17:50,060
never challenges you,

426
00:17:50,143 --> 00:17:51,646
and thanks you for helping her

427
00:17:51,652 --> 00:17:53,516
study for nursing school.

428
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:55,565
As a matter of fact, she
is studying for nursing.

429
00:17:55,649 --> 00:17:58,276
I know. I can hear your
flirting through the wall,

430
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,856
when you're supposedly
"working on your novel."

431
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:02,775
I bet you think she's
falling in love with you.

432
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,030
You sensitive, misunderstood artist.

433
00:18:05,036 --> 00:18:07,029
Ugh. Won't she be disappointed.

434
00:18:07,035 --> 00:18:09,067
I don't know why you don't
just get a divorce already.

435
00:18:09,073 --> 00:18:11,033
Oh, sure, that's the Hollywood way.

436
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,749
"We're out of mustard.
Let's get a divorce!"

437
00:18:12,832 --> 00:18:14,376
"I'm a little sad. Divorce!"

438
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:15,871
"We've grown apart over the years"

439
00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:17,748
and our adult child has
moved out of the house

440
00:18:17,754 --> 00:18:20,382
"and there's no reason for us
to stay together. Divorce!"

441
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:23,051
That actually is a legitimate
reason to get a divorce.

442
00:18:23,134 --> 00:18:24,786
Well, who else would have me now?

443
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:26,393
After what you did to my body?

444
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:29,015
- What I did?
- Anyway, do you want this painting?

445
00:18:29,021 --> 00:18:30,569
It belonged to your grandfather,

446
00:18:30,575 --> 00:18:32,555
a man who knew what marriage meant.

447
00:18:32,561 --> 00:18:34,724
Sure.

448
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,059
I drove it all the way
down here, didn't I?

449
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:39,103
- You might as well take it.
- I said I'll take it.

450
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:42,314
Of course. Take. That's all you ever do.

451
00:18:42,631 --> 00:18:44,425
How long you sticking around for, Mom?

452
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:46,825
Just pour me a drink
and I'll be on my way.

453
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:48,387
Yeah, let's get you good and liquored

454
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,863
up before you drive up the coast.

455
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:52,080
I got a date with Tonya Harding tonight.

456
00:18:52,163 --> 00:18:54,249
She was the good one?
I always get them confused.

457
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:55,917
I heard your show was canceled.

458
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,211
Three years ago now. You're
really on the pulse, huh?

459
00:18:58,295 --> 00:18:59,879
I never understood the appeal.

460
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:01,925
It's just a bunch of silly stories.

461
00:19:01,931 --> 00:19:03,430
Some people like silly stories.

462
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:05,176
Lotta good they ever did me.

463
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,386
It's not Ibsen, but...

464
00:19:06,469 --> 00:19:08,563
It would only depress me to watch

465
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:10,050
you bumble around like that.

466
00:19:10,056 --> 00:19:12,508
All the sacrifices I made,

467
00:19:12,514 --> 00:19:14,589
so that you could do this.

468
00:19:15,843 --> 00:19:18,204
Thanks for the painting.
It'll be nice to have something

469
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,447
that always reminds me
of this conversation.

470
00:19:31,641 --> 00:19:33,925
_

471
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,668
- Uh, Beatrice.
- What?

472
00:19:38,674 --> 00:19:40,477
I, uh...

473
00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:43,590
- I gummed things up.
- Oh?

474
00:19:43,673 --> 00:19:45,216
It's Henrietta.

475
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,010
The girl went and got herself pregnant.

476
00:19:47,093 --> 00:19:49,554
Oh, she got herself pregnant?

477
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,520
Can you talk to her?
Just woman to woman?

478
00:19:51,526 --> 00:19:54,392
She wants to have the baby.
I... I can't talk her out of it.

479
00:19:54,476 --> 00:19:57,145
- What do you want me to say?
- I'm out of options, Bea.

480
00:19:57,228 --> 00:19:59,814
You think I enjoy groveling
to my own wife, hat in hand?

481
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:02,400
If you weren't so neglectful
in your wifely duties...

482
00:20:02,484 --> 00:20:05,070
- Don't you dare.
- I'm sorry. What do...

483
00:20:05,153 --> 00:20:06,696
I don't know what to do. I...

484
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,718
Please. Just... just fix

485
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,391
this for me, please.

486
00:20:11,905 --> 00:20:14,061
I know you hate me, Bea,

487
00:20:14,364 --> 00:20:16,464
but please just think of the poor girl.

488
00:20:17,624 --> 00:20:20,335
Oh, God.

489
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:24,631
You're fired, of course.

490
00:20:24,714 --> 00:20:27,050
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Horseman.

491
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:29,636
He was just so kind
to me and I felt so...

492
00:20:29,642 --> 00:20:31,172
Let me guess, he said you

493
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,883
reminded him of his dead mother.

494
00:20:32,889 --> 00:20:35,009
He said she had hair like mine.

495
00:20:35,015 --> 00:20:37,065
He saw it in a picture once.

496
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,319
- Do you really want this child?
- I...

497
00:20:40,325 --> 00:20:41,753
I think so?

498
00:20:41,981 --> 00:20:44,693
It's a baby horse. A girl.

499
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,245
I need help. I'm studying to be a

500
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:50,578
nurse, and tuition keeps going up.

501
00:20:50,657 --> 00:20:52,283
None of that is my fault.

502
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:54,115
If I can just finish school

503
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:56,126
and get a job, it'll be okay.

504
00:20:56,204 --> 00:20:58,623
And who's going to care for
the baby while you work?

505
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:00,291
Because God knows he won't.

506
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:05,004
Well, don't do that.
What does that solve?

507
00:21:05,088 --> 00:21:06,729
I don't know what else to do,

508
00:21:06,735 --> 00:21:07,971
Mrs. Horseman.

509
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:11,088
All right. We'll pay for your tuition.

510
00:21:11,094 --> 00:21:13,430
- Really?
- Yes.

511
00:21:13,763 --> 00:21:16,182
And you'll give the
baby up for adoption.

512
00:21:17,475 --> 00:21:18,643
No.

513
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:20,979
You think you want this,
but you don't. Not like this.

514
00:21:20,985 --> 00:21:22,182
- Mrs. Horseman...
- Don't

515
00:21:22,188 --> 00:21:24,357
throw away your dreams for this child.

516
00:21:24,363 --> 00:21:25,825
Don't let that man poison

517
00:21:25,831 --> 00:21:27,657
your life the way he did mine.

518
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:30,363
You are going to finish your
schooling and become a nurse.

519
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:32,693
You'll meet a man, a good man,
and you'll have a family,

520
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:35,326
but please believe me,
you don't want this.

521
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,796
Oh...

522
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,330
Please, Henrietta,
you have to believe me.

523
00:21:39,414 --> 00:21:42,292
Please, don't do what I did.

524
00:21:43,838 --> 00:21:45,673
Mm-hmm.

525
00:21:55,138 --> 00:21:57,557
My... My baby! Where's my baby?

526
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:10,786
Oh, look at you.

527
00:22:11,237 --> 00:22:13,865
You did it, Henrietta.

528
00:22:13,948 --> 00:22:15,283
Oh, my God.

529
00:22:19,537 --> 00:22:21,790
No, no, no. No, please.

530
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,458
Please don't. Stop.

531
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:26,085
Stop! Why are you doing this?

532
00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:28,755
Beatrice, remember what
we say about crying?

533
00:22:28,838 --> 00:22:30,590
- Mm-hmm.
- Crying is stupid.

534
00:22:30,596 --> 00:22:33,051
But, Father, tell them
not to burn my things.

535
00:22:33,134 --> 00:22:34,771
But, darling, they have to.

536
00:22:34,777 --> 00:22:36,893
Your sickness has infected everything.

537
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:38,598
The hard part is over.

538
00:22:38,681 --> 00:22:40,642
Wait. Wait. I wanna hold her.

539
00:22:40,725 --> 00:22:42,519
- No. You'll get attached.
- Wait!

540
00:22:42,602 --> 00:22:45,230
It all must be destroyed
for your own good.

541
00:22:45,313 --> 00:22:47,398
- I need to hold her.
- This is for your own good.

542
00:22:47,482 --> 00:22:50,527
- But not my baby.
- Yes. Especially your baby.

543
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,778
Whoop!

544
00:22:51,826 --> 00:22:53,106
See, doesn't that feel better?

545
00:22:53,112 --> 00:22:55,865
No!

546
00:22:55,949 --> 00:22:57,492
My baby!

547
00:22:57,575 --> 00:22:59,160
Wait, please. I need to hold her.

548
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:00,333
No, no.

549
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:02,919
Wait. No, please come back.
I need to hold her. Please.

550
00:23:04,598 --> 00:23:05,850
No!

551
00:23:05,948 --> 00:23:07,741
Come on now, be strong.

552
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,380
You can't let your womanly
emotions consume you.

553
00:23:10,463 --> 00:23:12,924
You don't wanna end up like
your mother now, do you?

554
00:23:14,717 --> 00:23:16,761
- No.
- I promise.

555
00:23:16,844 --> 00:23:18,373
One day this will all

556
00:23:18,379 --> 00:23:20,428
be a pleasant memory.

557
00:23:28,817 --> 00:23:31,111
Best of luck. See ya never.

558
00:23:32,443 --> 00:23:35,280
- Who is that?
- Bye, Mom.

559
00:23:35,286 --> 00:23:36,718
BoJack?

560
00:23:37,532 --> 00:23:40,702
- Mom?
- BoJack? Is that you?

561
00:23:40,785 --> 00:23:42,161
Yeah, it's me.

562
00:23:42,245 --> 00:23:44,713
Well, oh, what is this place?

563
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:46,337
This is where you live now.

564
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:48,878
- No. Is it? No.
- Mom...

565
00:23:48,884 --> 00:23:50,912
- Where are we, BoJack?
- I just told you.

566
00:23:50,918 --> 00:23:52,044
I don't understand.

567
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,219
- Where... Where am I?
- You're...

568
00:23:56,282 --> 00:23:57,367
In Michigan.

569
00:23:57,474 --> 00:23:59,643
- Michigan?
- Yeah.

570
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:02,056
- At the lake house.
- I am?

571
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,767
It's a... It's a warm summer night,

572
00:24:04,773 --> 00:24:06,612
and the fireflies

573
00:24:06,618 --> 00:24:08,281
are dancing in the sky.

574
00:24:08,336 --> 00:24:11,297
And your whole family is here.

575
00:24:11,482 --> 00:24:12,725
And they're telling you that

576
00:24:12,731 --> 00:24:14,282
everything is gonna be all right.

577
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,397
Yes. That's right. What else?

578
00:24:17,742 --> 00:24:20,422
The crickets are... are chirping,

579
00:24:20,428 --> 00:24:22,454
and the lake is still,

580
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:24,098
and the night

581
00:24:24,252 --> 00:24:25,704
is full of stars.

582
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,791
I can see it. It's so clear.

583
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:31,169
What are we doing here, BoJack?

584
00:24:31,252 --> 00:24:33,065
We're sitting on the back porch,

585
00:24:33,088 --> 00:24:35,388
and we're listening to your
brother play the piano,

586
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,342
and we're eating ice cream.

587
00:24:37,348 --> 00:24:38,933
Vanilla ice cream.

588
00:24:39,093 --> 00:24:41,137
Yes. That's right.

589
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,015
Oh, it's all so marvelous.

590
00:24:44,098 --> 00:24:45,808
Can you taste the ice cream, Mom?

591
00:24:45,814 --> 00:24:47,732
Oh, BoJack.

592
00:24:47,738 --> 00:24:49,990
It's so...

593
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,815
Delicious.
