1
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,935
- We're live in five minutes, folks.
- Make way.

2
00:00:10,936 --> 00:00:14,064
Someone find out the average rainfall
in Bora Bora.

3
00:00:14,065 --> 00:00:15,691
Thank you so much for doing this.

4
00:00:15,692 --> 00:00:19,403
Hey, there are a lot of advantages to
being the girlfriend of a big celebrity.

5
00:00:19,404 --> 00:00:20,696
It's more than being an elbow

6
00:00:20,697 --> 00:00:23,156
they couldn't crop out of
a red-carpet shot in US Weekly.

7
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:25,950
- I've been that elbow.
- Hello, what have we here?

8
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:27,952
So you know
how the game's played, right?

9
00:00:27,953 --> 00:00:30,055
I'm sure I'll pick it up.
How hard could it be?

10
00:00:30,081 --> 00:00:32,123
You didn't read the treatment?
I faxed it to you.

11
00:00:32,124 --> 00:00:34,793
My bad, our fax machine
isn't plugged in.

12
00:00:34,794 --> 00:00:36,628
BoJack, this is our first show

13
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:39,548
and it is very important that things
run smoothly tonight.

14
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:41,592
I mean, do you even care
about this at all?

15
00:00:41,593 --> 00:00:45,262
Sweetie, no. I think this is stupid
and a waste of everybody's time.

16
00:00:45,263 --> 00:00:47,639
But you're my girlfriend
and I care about you.

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,058
- So I'm here.
- Okay. Break a leg.

18
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:53,729
Me, me, me. My, my, my.
Bow-wow-wow-wow.

19
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,939
Good boy, good boy.

20
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,609
Okay, this is it, everybody.
Moment of truth.

21
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,318
Now it's in the hands of god.

22
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:03,572
And for the next 30 minutes,
I am that God.

23
00:01:03,573 --> 00:01:05,824
- I got you an iPad, ma'am.
- Oh, no thanks, Mia.

24
00:01:05,825 --> 00:01:08,910
I'm still working my way through
the last 30 years of technology.

25
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:10,287
Right now I'm on Palm Pilot.

26
00:01:10,288 --> 00:01:12,932
But you can use our second screen app
to see what viewers say

27
00:01:12,957 --> 00:01:14,249
about the show as it airs.

28
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,086
Oh, cool,
I love stupid bullshit like this. Ooh.

29
00:01:18,087 --> 00:01:19,296
Oh, you just touch it.

30
00:01:19,297 --> 00:01:24,384
Hello, I am Mustache Todd.
Like regular Todd, but with a mustache.

31
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:28,513
Listen boo-boo, I didn't graduate first in
my class from a prestigious university,

32
00:01:28,514 --> 00:01:31,182
rise through the ranks at
an elite news organization,

33
00:01:31,183 --> 00:01:33,893
win a well-known award,
never ever be sick at sea

34
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:37,939
and also my name is Mia McKibben,
so that I could deal with your nonsense.

35
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,024
Todd, stay out of Hair and Makeup.

36
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:41,234
But I like it there.

37
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:44,112
They brush my hair and tell me stories
about their weekends.

38
00:01:44,113 --> 00:01:47,365
Big-nosed Todd wasn't funny,
Zombie Todd wasn't funny,

39
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:49,117
Pretty Lady Todd wasn't funny,

40
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:51,411
and this isn't funny.
No more tomfoolery.

41
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:54,098
When it's me,
we call it "Todd-foolery."

42
00:01:54,123 --> 00:01:56,374
We certainly do not call it that.

43
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,459
Listen up, everyone.

44
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,711
What you are part of tonight
is bigger than you.

45
00:01:59,712 --> 00:02:01,087
It's bigger than any of us.

46
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,922
I expect all of you to work together.

47
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:06,134
But I also expect that one of you
will tower above the rest.

48
00:02:06,135 --> 00:02:11,640
And that outstanding individual
will receive this pen.

49
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:14,100
It was through this pen that I bled

50
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:17,688
Raise High The Roof Beam,
Carpenters upon the page.

51
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:19,397
Also, it has four different colors.

52
00:02:19,398 --> 00:02:22,192
Black, red, blue
and for some reason, green.

53
00:02:22,193 --> 00:02:23,527
By the end of tonight,

54
00:02:23,528 --> 00:02:27,364
this pen will be bestowed upon
the person most deserving.

55
00:02:27,365 --> 00:02:30,074
Because nothing is more
important than television,

56
00:02:30,075 --> 00:02:33,953
and no one more important than
the people who make that television.

57
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:38,058
- Now, let's get to work.
- And five, four,

58
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:41,562
- three, two...
- Showtime.

59
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,272
Live from the historic
Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip,

60
00:03:42,273 --> 00:03:43,690
J.D. Salinger Presents:

61
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:46,693
Hollywoo Stars And Celebrities,
What Do They Know?

62
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:49,630
Do They Know Things?
Let's Find Out!

63
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,785
Ah. All right! Here we go.

64
00:03:54,786 --> 00:03:55,911
Listen to that crowd.

65
00:03:55,912 --> 00:03:58,037
If they lose it this much
for Mr. Peanutbutter,

66
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,850
can you imagine what they're going to
do for a real celebrity?

67
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:04,168
Hey, this is Mr. Peanutbutter's show,
so be nice.

68
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:06,296
When you say nice, do you mean kind?

69
00:04:06,297 --> 00:04:08,214
Or, like,
delivering a lot of sick burns,

70
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,759
so that people in the audience go,
"Nice."

71
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,470
The first one. Obviously the first one.

72
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:15,889
Tonight we answer the age-old question:

73
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,850
"Hollywoo stars and celebrities,
what do they know?

74
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:21,328
Do they know things?
Let's find out!"

75
00:04:23,648 --> 00:04:25,315
And now our first-ever guest.

76
00:04:25,316 --> 00:04:27,859
You know him from his years on
Horsin' Around,

77
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,653
his drunk appearance on The View,

78
00:04:29,654 --> 00:04:34,032
and his bestselling book,
it's BoJack Horseman.

79
00:04:36,285 --> 00:04:37,911
There you are. How are you doing?

80
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:40,180
- BoJack, welcome.
- It is great to be here.

81
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:42,874
Sorry, no time for idle chit-chat,
because we've entered

82
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,061
- the Small Talk Round.
- The what now?

83
00:04:47,212 --> 00:04:50,507
Thirty seconds on the clock.
BoJack, how are you?

84
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:52,968
- Uh, fine?
- Correct.

85
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:55,053
- Did you see the game last night?
- No, I don't follow...

86
00:04:55,054 --> 00:04:56,304
Oh.

87
00:04:56,305 --> 00:04:58,974
Oh, so sorry.
It says here you did see the game.

88
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:01,601
- What game?
- Ready camera one? Camera one.

89
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,370
You tell me.
You're the one who saw it.

90
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:04,688
I don't...

91
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:07,732
God, no!

92
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:09,150
- What the...?
- That noise means

93
00:05:09,151 --> 00:05:11,820
it's time for your first
General Knowledge question.

94
00:05:11,821 --> 00:05:14,656
Audience, does BoJack know things?

95
00:05:14,657 --> 00:05:17,116
Let's find out!

96
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:20,871
BoJack, what is the average
annual rainfall in Bora Bora?

97
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:24,642
- Uh, this is general knowledge?
- It's just an average we're asking for.

98
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:28,211
- I don't know, seven?
- Wrong! So wrong.

99
00:05:28,212 --> 00:05:29,963
Wow, when it comes to Bora Bora,

100
00:05:29,964 --> 00:05:33,424
maybe this celebrity should
have studied more-a more-a.

101
00:05:33,425 --> 00:05:36,344
Yes, Mr. Peanutbutter. Go for the kill.

102
00:05:36,345 --> 00:05:38,847
- That doesn't really seem...
- They're all dead!

103
00:05:38,848 --> 00:05:40,932
I watched them die!

104
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:42,642
- What is...?
- Oh-ho. That sound means

105
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,435
it's time to pick your category.

106
00:05:44,436 --> 00:05:50,400
"Trigonometry." "Advanced Physics,"
and "At the Movies With Mr. Peanutbutter."

107
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:52,276
At the Movies With
Mr. Peanutbutter.

108
00:05:52,277 --> 00:05:56,698
Good choice. After seeing J.J. Abrams'
Star Trek reboot, did I call it:

109
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:58,950
A, "A visual feast for the senses,"

110
00:05:58,951 --> 00:06:01,870
B, "A zestful lark through time
and space,"

111
00:06:01,871 --> 00:06:05,099
C, "The best Zachary Quinto movie
of all time,"

112
00:06:05,124 --> 00:06:07,375
or D, "All of the above"?

113
00:06:07,376 --> 00:06:11,546
- I'll say D?
- Ouch, the answer was A and B.

114
00:06:11,547 --> 00:06:13,131
Though I would
also agree with C.

115
00:06:13,132 --> 00:06:16,300
So I told Mr. Peanutbutter
I'd drive him here,

116
00:06:16,301 --> 00:06:19,262
and next thing I know,
I'm an Associate Producer.

117
00:06:19,263 --> 00:06:21,639
Stupid me. I went to Stanford.

118
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,434
Next time I'll just try that
thing where I'm a huge dumb-ass

119
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:26,686
who happens to be friends
with Mr. Peanutbutter.

120
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:27,687
- Yup.
- Cool.

121
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:29,606
Well, have fun watching me
win that pen.

122
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:30,732
I don't need a pen.

123
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:35,570
I can walk into any Chili's with a child
under 12 and get crayons for free.

124
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:36,905
You don't get it.

125
00:06:36,906 --> 00:06:39,741
If Salinger gives you his pen,
that means you're worth something.

126
00:06:39,742 --> 00:06:42,619
It means you're a serious person
who's going places.

127
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,598
Actually, you know what?
Don't worry about it. It's not for you.

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,418
I'm gonna go with nuclear fusion.

129
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:52,921
Oh, the answer is Egypt.

130
00:06:52,922 --> 00:06:55,715
Turn up the directional heat lamps.
Oh, yeah.

131
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,235
Let's really make him sweat.

132
00:06:58,343 --> 00:07:00,011
Surprised you didn't get that one,

133
00:07:00,012 --> 00:07:03,807
since you're an expert
when it comes to DE-Nile.

134
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:06,660
Quick impression.
"I'm not an alcoholic."

135
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:08,895
You love it.

136
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:13,024
Oh, yeah, pretty good one from King Mutt
over here. Am I right?

137
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:15,485
You know, like King Tut?

138
00:07:15,486 --> 00:07:18,839
Because we're talking about Egypt?
And Mr. Peanutbutter's a mutt, so...

139
00:07:19,782 --> 00:07:21,324
You suck.

140
00:07:21,325 --> 00:07:22,909
I'm a yellow lab, BoJack.

141
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,912
You could get one thing right tonight.

142
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:28,974
Anyway, let's take a moment
to look at the great comments

143
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,084
we've been getting on
our second screen app,

144
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:32,460
now available for download.

145
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:34,963
And we're out.
Fifteen seconds, everybody.

146
00:07:34,964 --> 00:07:37,381
- Hey, how am I doing?
- You're kind of being a dick.

147
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:39,342
Hey, are we at Tony Roma's right now?

148
00:07:39,343 --> 00:07:41,594
Because there's a lot
of ribbing going on here.

149
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:43,680
I'm not ribbing you.
I'm telling you, you're...

150
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:47,600
And we're back in three, two...

151
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:48,726
Welcome back.

152
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:52,730
Will BoJack Horseman go down in show
history as our worst contestant ever?

153
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:54,541
So far, yes.

154
00:07:55,818 --> 00:07:58,319
Wow. J.D., people are loving this show.

155
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,033
Wait till they see this.
Mia, get ready to drop the bomb.

156
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:05,177
Death from above!

157
00:08:05,536 --> 00:08:09,640
Uh-oh. That sound means it's time
to drop "DA" bomb.

158
00:08:09,665 --> 00:08:11,875
And yes folks, I said "DA," not "the."

159
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:14,293
What I'm trying to say is,
it's a positive bomb.

160
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,004
Audience, let's...

161
00:08:16,005 --> 00:08:18,464
Drop DA bomb!

162
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:21,360
Did you guys all practice
before the show, because...

163
00:08:22,594 --> 00:08:26,097
Ladies and gentlemen, we've had
some fun with our little celebrity.

164
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:28,349
But now, let's meet our big celebrity.

165
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,768
- Big celebrity?
- Say hello to...

166
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:34,498
- Daniel Radcliffe!
- Hi, I'm Daniel Radcliffe. Hello.

167
00:08:34,565 --> 00:08:37,275
Oh, my God! It's Daniel Radcliffe!

168
00:08:37,276 --> 00:08:41,297
We'll find out what our big celebrity
knows right after this break.

169
00:08:42,865 --> 00:08:46,635
And we're out.
Oh, we're cooking now.

170
00:08:47,536 --> 00:08:49,579
Hey, you, you're doing great.

171
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,556
I'm not 100 percent watching

172
00:08:51,582 --> 00:08:53,583
because I'm so engrossed
in the second screen experience,

173
00:08:53,584 --> 00:08:55,668
but according to
the second screen experience,

174
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:57,503
other people are loving the show.

175
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,630
You didn't tell me
there would be another celebrity.

176
00:08:59,631 --> 00:09:01,258
Well, I had no idea that was coming

177
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:05,053
but some guy named Dong-Slinger-420
loved the surprise.

178
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:07,055
He said, "Two dongs way up."

179
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:10,474
There was no mention of another bigger
celebrity in the document you faxed?

180
00:09:10,475 --> 00:09:13,228
I couldn't read it. My fax machine
cut it into little strips.

181
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:16,273
- That sounds like a shredder.
- Well, I guess I shredded it to you.

182
00:09:16,274 --> 00:09:17,648
I gotta deal with this.

183
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:20,068
If I don't interact with this app
every 80 seconds,

184
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:22,779
it charges my credit card five dollars.
Love you.

185
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,281
Ehh... you, too.

186
00:09:24,282 --> 00:09:26,283
Could you get the base
a little less pale?

187
00:09:26,284 --> 00:09:29,035
- Hey, Daniel, good to see you.
- Always nice to meet a fan.

188
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:33,206
- No, sorry, I'm not a, uh... I'm an actor.
- Oh, good for you.

189
00:09:33,207 --> 00:09:35,600
It's a dreadful business
but hang in there.

190
00:09:35,626 --> 00:09:38,128
No, I already did hang in there.
I'm BoJack Horseman?

191
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:39,420
We've actually met before.

192
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:42,715
At Chris Martin's holiday party?
We stepped outside for a smoke?

193
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:44,550
- To get away from Chris Martin?
- Huh.

194
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,677
You opened up
about your fear of success?

195
00:09:46,678 --> 00:09:47,971
I gave you some advice?

196
00:09:47,972 --> 00:09:51,474
You said I was a true friend
and you would never forget me?

197
00:09:51,475 --> 00:09:54,144
And you said your name
was Chadwick Boseman?

198
00:09:54,145 --> 00:09:56,187
- BoJack Horseman.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

199
00:09:56,188 --> 00:09:59,398
When you're as famous as I am,
you meet so many people.

200
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,151
Sorry, we need you guys back on set.

201
00:10:01,152 --> 00:10:04,088
You were the second hairdresser's
assistant on The Ellen Show

202
00:10:04,113 --> 00:10:06,030
about five years ago.
Veronica, right?

203
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:08,908
- Yeah, that's right.
- How was your mother's party in the end?

204
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:12,996
And we're back in five, four,
three, two...

205
00:10:12,997 --> 00:10:14,664
So you never say one, huh?

206
00:10:14,665 --> 00:10:17,809
- Welcome back, America.
- We love you, Daniel.

207
00:10:17,835 --> 00:10:21,754
So do I. So let's watch
our celebrities go... Audience?

208
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:24,257
Head to head!

209
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:26,050
How could they possibly know that?

210
00:10:26,051 --> 00:10:28,303
This is the first episode, right?

211
00:10:28,304 --> 00:10:32,140
The puppets clap
when the puppetmaster pulls the strings.

212
00:10:32,141 --> 00:10:35,476
Hello. Serious,
Going-Places Todd at your service.

213
00:10:35,477 --> 00:10:38,646
Hey, look at you, all dressed up
for the Dipshit Awards.

214
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:40,898
You know you're not allowed
in Hair and Makeup.

215
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:43,818
- Are you wearing roller skates?
- I'm wearing Heelys.

216
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:46,654
They're shoes with wheels,
for efficiency purposes.

217
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:50,700
- Now I can be serious faster.
- You can also go nowhere faster.

218
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:53,244
Seeing as I am a professional...

219
00:10:53,245 --> 00:10:55,288
No!

220
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:57,224
Oh, BoJack.

221
00:10:57,249 --> 00:10:59,458
Another embarrassingly
wrong answer,

222
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:03,713
bringing your score down
by 80 points and 12 dollars.

223
00:11:03,714 --> 00:11:05,882
Why are we playing
for both points and dollars?

224
00:11:05,883 --> 00:11:08,551
- Oh, tough break, B.J. Novak!
- My name is...

225
00:11:08,552 --> 00:11:10,428
Our next question is to Mr. Radcliffe.

226
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:14,724
"What color comes from
the combination of blue and yellow?"

227
00:11:14,725 --> 00:11:16,017
I actually know this one.

228
00:11:16,018 --> 00:11:18,519
When I was growing up,
my neighbor was a painter.

229
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,980
I remember visiting his flat
and watching him work.

230
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:24,108
Sometimes he would mix together
blue paint with yellow paint

231
00:11:24,109 --> 00:11:26,027
and it made an entirely new color.

232
00:11:26,028 --> 00:11:28,738
And that man was Banksy.
And that color was green.

233
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:30,990
- Final answer.
- Correct!

234
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:33,034
You've earned
the chance to go for a spin

235
00:11:33,035 --> 00:11:35,429
in our KIA Sportage Cash Grab Booth.

236
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:39,224
Oh, splendid.

237
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,626
And while Daniel's in the booth,
BoJack, you have an essay question.

238
00:11:42,627 --> 00:11:44,879
- What?
- You'll find a blue book on your podium.

239
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,924
"To what extent was feudalism
a cause of the French Revolution?"

240
00:11:47,925 --> 00:11:49,592
- Wait, are you ser... Oh!
- And go!

241
00:11:49,593 --> 00:11:51,761
While BoJack works,
let's check out the action

242
00:11:51,762 --> 00:11:54,573
on our KIA Sportage Cash Grab Booth Cam.

243
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:57,600
- Hey, champ.
- What are you doing here?

244
00:11:57,601 --> 00:11:58,851
I'm trying to write an essay.

245
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:00,603
I came to ask you how you were doing

246
00:12:00,604 --> 00:12:02,897
and then to tell you
you're not doing so well.

247
00:12:02,898 --> 00:12:04,607
Why am I getting
the hard questions,

248
00:12:04,608 --> 00:12:06,859
while Boy Wizard over there
just has to know colors

249
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,879
and literally grab cash out of thin air?

250
00:12:08,987 --> 00:12:11,822
A five! This is so easy!

251
00:12:11,823 --> 00:12:15,368
I think I might be able to help you out.
Let me tell you a story.

252
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:17,370
The year was 2003

253
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:20,748
and for some reason, everyone was
playing poker all of a sudden.

254
00:12:20,749 --> 00:12:25,312
A then-relevant Wilmer Valderrama
used to host a weekly how-do-you-do

255
00:12:25,337 --> 00:12:28,631
and all the stars
came out to show off their tricks.

256
00:12:28,632 --> 00:12:33,052
There was Lucy Lawless, Lucy Liu,
Lori Laughlin, Lisa Loeb,

257
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,972
the dog from Frasier,
and at the head of the table?

258
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:39,683
Big Money himself, Mr. Peanutbutter.

259
00:12:39,684 --> 00:12:41,119
Whoops. Woh-oh.

260
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:43,247
I thought, "Here's a rube."

261
00:12:44,982 --> 00:12:48,192
But Lady Luck had other plans.

262
00:12:48,193 --> 00:12:49,735
You know what,
I got an essay to write,

263
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:52,530
so if this isn't about the precipitous
fall of the French ruling class...

264
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:55,634
But then I saw, the kid had a tell.

265
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:01,080
I feel like that story had a lot
of unnecessary details in it.

266
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:04,602
Listen. You have to pay close attention,
it's subtle,

267
00:13:04,626 --> 00:13:10,089
but when he gets excited, his ears ever
so slightly flop up and give him away.

268
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,551
Well, that's no surprise. Guy's been
flopping upwards his whole career.

269
00:13:13,552 --> 00:13:16,488
Mm-hm. Watch the ears.

270
00:13:18,307 --> 00:13:20,391
Time's up, Daniel.

271
00:13:20,392 --> 00:13:23,936
Whoa, looks like D to the R
to the Ad to the Cliffe

272
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:26,981
just won 54,000 bonus dollars.

273
00:13:26,982 --> 00:13:30,943
And BoJack barely got beyond
his thesis statement.

274
00:13:31,903 --> 00:13:34,447
"A continent ravaged by war,

275
00:13:34,448 --> 00:13:37,283
coupled with the retreat
of the church from secular life..."

276
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,327
And then it just stops?

277
00:13:39,328 --> 00:13:42,246
Oh, that's gonna cost
you some serious pesos.

278
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:45,350
But first, it's time for
our Multiple Choice Buzz-In Round.

279
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:47,084
A buzz-in round? All right.

280
00:13:47,085 --> 00:13:49,587
In is my favorite direction
in which to buzz.

281
00:13:49,588 --> 00:13:52,089
Tell me, "How many oak trees are needed

282
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:56,677
to build an 18th century triple-Decker
Royal Navy battle ship?

283
00:13:56,678 --> 00:14:00,181
A, 75? B, 1000?

284
00:14:00,182 --> 00:14:02,308
Or C, 3500?"

285
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:04,453
C! 3500!

286
00:14:04,686 --> 00:14:06,604
- Um, correct.
- Uh, what?

287
00:14:06,605 --> 00:14:08,606
Uh, wow. That's, uh...

288
00:14:08,607 --> 00:14:10,274
That's actually correct.

289
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:13,819
How the hell did he know that? What else
does he know? Does he know things?

290
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,838
Let's find out.

291
00:14:15,864 --> 00:14:19,909
Quantum tunneling.
King Magnus the Second.

292
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,412
Miss Scarlet in the library
with the lead pipe.

293
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:25,415
Sassafras. Butterscotch! Argyle.

294
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,310
Because seven eight nine.

295
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:31,962
What an amazing run.
It looks like we've got a tied game.

296
00:14:31,963 --> 00:14:34,965
Which is an exciting surprise.

297
00:14:34,966 --> 00:14:37,927
- Goddamn it, throw to commercial.
- We'll be right back.

298
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:44,683
- Hey. Horshack. What's going on?
- What's going on is I'm kicking your ass.

299
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:47,770
Yeah, you know, you're doing great,
but I'm supposed to win.

300
00:14:47,771 --> 00:14:50,440
That was the deal.
Plug my movie, win money for charity.

301
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:52,525
Well, tell Charity she can kiss my ass.

302
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:54,277
By the way,
your girlfriend has a stripper name.

303
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:57,506
It's not my girlfriend, it's charity.

304
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:03,620
BoJack, according to this app,
you're almost tied.

305
00:15:03,621 --> 00:15:06,581
Oh, you are tied, there's a lag.
Congratulations.

306
00:15:06,582 --> 00:15:08,332
Thanks. It was touch and go...

307
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,809
But I'm a little concerned

308
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:12,462
because it seems like
you might actually win,

309
00:15:12,463 --> 00:15:15,131
but everyone on the app
is really rooting for Daniel.

310
00:15:15,132 --> 00:15:16,299
People love him.

311
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,470
I guess he was in some movie about a
potter or a Pottery Barn or something?

312
00:15:20,471 --> 00:15:23,764
- Are you asking me to throw the game?
- You don't care about this game.

313
00:15:23,765 --> 00:15:27,310
The only reason you're here is for me,
so maybe you could help me out?

314
00:15:27,311 --> 00:15:29,353
- Okay.
- You know what?

315
00:15:29,354 --> 00:15:32,607
You're the best, no matter
what everybody on this app says.

316
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:37,879
They say you're the worst. Especially
Queefburglar69. He's their leader.

317
00:15:39,948 --> 00:15:44,452
And we're back. Contestants, I've got
a history question for both of you.

318
00:15:44,453 --> 00:15:50,308
"You may or may not be familiar with a
famous racehorse named Secretariat.

319
00:15:50,334 --> 00:15:53,419
In what year did Secretariat
win the Triple Crown?"

320
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,671
BoJack.

321
00:15:54,672 --> 00:15:56,273
Piece of cake.

322
00:15:56,381 --> 00:15:58,024
Hmm?

323
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:01,844
Um, 1492?

324
00:16:01,845 --> 00:16:04,555
What? No, not even close.

325
00:16:04,556 --> 00:16:07,558
BoJack, aren't you in a movie
about Secretariat?

326
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:11,145
- How could you not know that?
- Let's just move on.

327
00:16:11,146 --> 00:16:13,189
Maybe instead,
he should be in a movie

328
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:16,693
about a guy who doesn't know
anything about Secretariat.

329
00:16:16,694 --> 00:16:18,277
That would not be a good movie.

330
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:21,572
I mean, more like Secre-terrible.

331
00:16:21,573 --> 00:16:24,492
Damn, Bojangles, you got served.

332
00:16:24,493 --> 00:16:28,287
Do you know anything about Secretariat?
You know he was a horse, right?

333
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,665
Oh, wait, did I just spoil it for you?

334
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:33,727
No wonder my wife
had to write your book for you.

335
00:16:33,752 --> 00:16:37,921
Hey, yeah, you know, while we're talking
about your wife, I've got a question.

336
00:16:37,922 --> 00:16:41,091
How come your wife flew
all the way to war-torn Cordovia

337
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:42,569
just to get away from you?

338
00:16:43,595 --> 00:16:46,013
That's not what happened.
She went to help people.

339
00:16:46,014 --> 00:16:49,534
Or maybe she went to help herself
get away from her awful marriage.

340
00:16:50,728 --> 00:16:54,605
- Oh, was that too far?
- Oh-ho, you want to get into things?

341
00:16:54,606 --> 00:16:57,024
- Well, I mean...
- No, no, no, let's get into things.

342
00:16:57,025 --> 00:17:01,004
Let's get real.
Everybody, BoJack wants to get real.

343
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:05,008
Cancel the Bubble Round.
Because we're getting real.

344
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,035
Should we cut to commercial?

345
00:17:08,036 --> 00:17:10,204
Would Homer cut away
from Odysseus's journey

346
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:13,249
just as he was being enticed
by the sirens' song?

347
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,852
No?

348
00:17:14,876 --> 00:17:16,377
Well, there you are.

349
00:17:16,378 --> 00:17:19,505
Things are getting real out here.
Really real.

350
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:22,317
Really, really, really real!

351
00:17:24,386 --> 00:17:26,721
- Uh, I'm not sure where you're going...
- Oh, no?

352
00:17:26,722 --> 00:17:28,723
You knew
where you were going with my wife

353
00:17:28,724 --> 00:17:31,058
that time you pulled over
by the side of the road.

354
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:33,436
- You know, a week before we got married?
- Uh...

355
00:17:33,437 --> 00:17:35,605
You want to talk about that, BoJack?

356
00:17:35,606 --> 00:17:40,610
You want to talk about the time when you,
my "good friend," kissed my wife?

357
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:41,985
- No!
- Yes.

358
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:43,529
Did something
exciting just happen?

359
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:47,157
Because people on the app are,
and I quote, "losing their tits."

360
00:17:47,158 --> 00:17:50,369
Oh, no, no, I've stumbled on to
a cancer support message board.

361
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,704
Okay, how do I...?

362
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:53,080
How did you know about that?

363
00:17:53,081 --> 00:17:55,934
Well, there are roadside cameras
all along the PCH,

364
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:58,001
I have a few friends
in the highway patrol,

365
00:17:58,002 --> 00:18:00,212
and she told me, of course! We're married!

366
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:03,507
Wait, so you've known all this time?

367
00:18:03,508 --> 00:18:06,510
Now this is television. Turn on the rain.

368
00:18:06,511 --> 00:18:09,012
Um, don't you think
you're pushing them too far?

369
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:12,475
I'll tell you when it's too far.
This is my art, goddamn it.

370
00:18:12,476 --> 00:18:17,497
I'm J. goddamn D.
goddamn Salinger, and I want rain!

371
00:18:20,024 --> 00:18:22,901
All I ever wanted was to be your friend.

372
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:26,280
And you treat me like a big joke.

373
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:28,699
You think I don't notice?
Why don't you like me?

374
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,909
- Mr. Peanutbutter...
- No, tell me.

375
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,037
- Because... I'm jealous.
- Oh.

376
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:37,374
- Of what? Diane?
- No.

377
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:40,687
Of everything.
Everything comes so easy for you.

378
00:18:40,712 --> 00:18:42,254
Oh, and it doesn't for you?

379
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:45,508
You're a millionaire movie star
with a girlfriend who loves you,

380
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:49,303
acting in your dream movie.
What more do you want?

381
00:18:49,304 --> 00:18:52,640
What else could
the universe possibly owe you?

382
00:18:52,641 --> 00:18:56,560
I want to feel good about myself.

383
00:18:56,561 --> 00:19:00,189
The way you do.
And I don't know how.

384
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,816
I don't know if I can.

385
00:19:01,817 --> 00:19:05,068
Whoa, guys, this is getting
a little heavy, don't we think?

386
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:07,338
I'm sorry, Mr. Peanutbutter.

387
00:19:07,405 --> 00:19:09,633
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

388
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:14,662
Wow, um, I don't know
if I can forgive you.

389
00:19:14,663 --> 00:19:18,123
But I guess we'll find out
right after this break.

390
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:22,270
- Damn.
- Shut up.

391
00:19:24,756 --> 00:19:28,258
I knew it. I knew this show would
bring us to the heights of human drama

392
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:30,720
more powerfully than literature
ever dreamed.

393
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:33,972
Now somebody go out and get me
a Red Bull and a banana fish sandwich.

394
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:37,434
On it. It's a perfect day for a Red Bull.

395
00:19:37,435 --> 00:19:38,745
Whoa-oh!

396
00:19:38,854 --> 00:19:41,397
- Mr. Peanutbutter!
- Oh, hey Wanda.

397
00:19:41,398 --> 00:19:44,608
I'm only half paying attention
to whatever you two are arguing about

398
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:47,528
but it's killer.
Now all we need is a happy ending.

399
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:50,656
I don't think we can just resolve
everything cleanly in a half-hour.

400
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:52,491
Uh, this is network television.

401
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:56,787
So resolving everything cleanly
in a half-hour is kind of what we do.

402
00:19:56,788 --> 00:19:59,874
You want to host a game show where
everyone feels bad at the end?

403
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:03,561
You can get in your little car, drive to
Santa Monica and pitch it to AMC.

404
00:20:03,587 --> 00:20:06,380
But these people want resolution, okay?

405
00:20:06,381 --> 00:20:10,568
So you get your little butt back
on that stage and you resolve.

406
00:20:10,802 --> 00:20:13,196
Uh...

407
00:20:13,304 --> 00:20:15,013
And we're back.

408
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:18,451
You know, I did some thinking
over the break. BoJack...

409
00:20:20,395 --> 00:20:21,729
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God.

410
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,456
No! No! What's happening?

411
00:20:23,648 --> 00:20:25,083
Oh.

412
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:33,240
Someone unplugged the main power line
and plugged in a George Foreman Grill.

413
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:36,410
Panini time. Hey, who unplugged...

414
00:20:36,411 --> 00:20:39,162
Todd! Goddamnit, step aside!

415
00:20:39,163 --> 00:20:42,332
Mia, good work.
You saved the show.

416
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,729
You earned my respect... and this pen.

417
00:20:46,337 --> 00:20:48,606
Oh, thank you.

418
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:50,859
Aww.

419
00:20:51,009 --> 00:20:54,804
Oh, are we back? We're back!
Live television, folks.

420
00:20:54,805 --> 00:20:57,890
You know, during the break,
my producers told me

421
00:20:57,891 --> 00:21:00,768
I had to forgive BoJack
live on the air.

422
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,980
But I'm my own dog.

423
00:21:03,981 --> 00:21:06,690
And as my own dog, I decided

424
00:21:06,691 --> 00:21:10,611
to forgive BoJack live on the air!
Bring it in, buddy!

425
00:21:10,612 --> 00:21:11,737
- What?
- Really?

426
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:14,281
Mr. Peanutbutter,
I applaud your forgiving nature,

427
00:21:14,282 --> 00:21:16,909
but this guy kissed your wife.

428
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,077
Wait, BoJack kissed Diane?

429
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:23,457
The only way to even the score
is if you get to kiss him.

430
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,061
- Wait, what?
- You're right, it makes perfect sense.

431
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:27,878
- Yeah, absolutely.
- No, it doesn't.

432
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:30,464
That way Diane and I will have
had the same experience.

433
00:21:30,465 --> 00:21:32,800
It's the only way we can move past this.

434
00:21:33,718 --> 00:21:35,970
Well, if it helps us move past this,
I guess...

435
00:21:35,971 --> 00:21:40,599
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

436
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,994
Cue the Kiss Cam.

437
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:52,569
Oh, if only I'd had a Kiss Cam
for Catcher In The Rye.

438
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,966
Well, just one more regret
on a long list of many.

439
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,870
Todd, there you are. You're missing
a pretty big moment out there.

440
00:22:00,871 --> 00:22:06,249
I don't care. You said it yourself.
Without that pen, I'm totally worthless.

441
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,854
Not for nothing, but you were worthless
before you didn't get the pen.

442
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:16,218
I really tried this time. I guess
I'll never really amount to anything.

443
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:20,222
Well, maybe you just need
someone to believe in you.

444
00:22:20,223 --> 00:22:23,893
Wow, no one's ever
fallen for that!

445
00:22:23,894 --> 00:22:26,478
- What?
- You're so stupid!

446
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:30,190
You had the pen
and you just gave it to me?!

447
00:22:30,191 --> 00:22:32,651
Oh, I can't believe that worked.

448
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:36,113
Oh, my God, look at your stupid face.

449
00:22:36,114 --> 00:22:37,823
The pen is just a symbol.
It doesn't...

450
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:41,326
Yeah, said the girl
who doesn't have a pen right now.

451
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:45,497
Unbelievable. You are the most annoying,
immature, aggravating,

452
00:22:45,498 --> 00:22:47,457
irritating, crazy-making...

453
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:51,021
Oh, she was mad, all right. But kids?

454
00:22:51,046 --> 00:22:54,899
That's the story of
how I met... this pen.

455
00:22:56,134 --> 00:22:59,011
Hey, get out of Hair and Makeup
and give me back my pen!

456
00:22:59,012 --> 00:23:02,264
I got your pen.
That means you respect me.

457
00:23:02,265 --> 00:23:04,975
- No it does not.
- Viva Todd-foolery!

458
00:23:04,976 --> 00:23:06,769
Suck a dick, dumbshits.

459
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,663
Hey! Hey, hey!

460
00:23:11,608 --> 00:23:14,777
Well, that stern but supple kiss
puts you over the top.

461
00:23:14,778 --> 00:23:17,338
BoJack Horseman is tonight's winner.

462
00:23:18,949 --> 00:23:21,283
Well played, Jock-jam Door-slam.

463
00:23:21,284 --> 00:23:24,494
You've earned $500,000 for charity.

464
00:23:24,495 --> 00:23:29,458
You can walk away right now
or, and remember, this is for charity,

465
00:23:29,459 --> 00:23:32,478
you can risk it all in
our Double or Nothing round.

466
00:23:34,965 --> 00:23:36,715
I wanna risk it all!

467
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:40,052
All right. Now that's $500,000.

468
00:23:40,053 --> 00:23:42,429
If you get this question right,
you double that,

469
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,306
a million dollars for charity.

470
00:23:44,307 --> 00:23:46,642
But if you get it wrong,
the charity gets nothing

471
00:23:46,643 --> 00:23:51,438
and all the money will be set on fire
live here on our studio soundstage.

472
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:54,108
BoJack, for all the marbles:

473
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:56,986
"Which famous actor
played the titular role

474
00:23:56,987 --> 00:24:00,631
in the popular Harry Potter
film franchise?"

475
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,866
- Oh.
- Huh.

476
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:05,368
Yeah. I don't know.

477
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:08,205
When you're as famous as I am,
you meet so many people,

478
00:24:08,206 --> 00:24:10,457
it's impossible to remember them all.

479
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:12,936
Okay, I get what you're doing. Very funny.

480
00:24:12,961 --> 00:24:16,213
Yeah. Oh, what is that guy's name?

481
00:24:16,214 --> 00:24:18,715
You know, it's on the tip of my tongue?

482
00:24:18,716 --> 00:24:21,177
Are you serious right now?
Dude, this is for charity.

483
00:24:21,178 --> 00:24:23,929
- BoJack, we need an answer.
- Yeah, I don't know.

484
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,782
Gosh, I wanna say...

485
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:30,745
- Elijah Wood?
- What?

486
00:24:31,813 --> 00:24:33,456
Elijah Wood?!

487
00:25:20,695 --> 00:25:24,007
Boxer versus raptor.
Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Na.
