1
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:08,634
So you said let's do
the show about the horse,

2
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:11,011
- but this time without the horse.
- I know, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:13,055
And I said, "That's a terrible idea."

4
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,599
And you said, "I got someone
even better." I got...

5
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:19,353
- What's this asshole's name again?
- Vincent D'Onofrio.

6
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,022
- And here we are.
- Okay. Action!

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,318
Hey, Zoe. Hey, Zelda.

8
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,780
- I forgot my boombox.
- And your deodorant.

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,823
Pee-yew, mister.

10
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:35,285
- Zoe, that's no way to get adopted.
- Adopted, by me?

11
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,621
Children, I'm a single
breakdancing instructor

12
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,456
who can barely take care of himself.

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,126
Plus, I'm too rad to be a dad.

14
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,836
Ooh!

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,130
And shake it up. Hah!

16
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,799
Cut!

17
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,406
It's fine, Katrina.

18
00:00:51,407 --> 00:00:53,929
If I didn't randomly wander
into doors all the time,

19
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,557
I never would have ended up
co-piloting the very plane

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,100
that brought me to Los Angeles.

21
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:01,645
Excuse me, didn't you see the
flashing red light outside the door?

22
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,106
Of course. That's why I stopped...

23
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,024
what I was doing to come inside.

24
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:10,487
Ooh, are you filming a
sitcom? I love sitcoms!

25
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,948
You should have a character
say, "Talk to the hand."

26
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:16,535
The hand! Not the face,
where the ears are.

27
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,579
Newsflash: hands can't hear.

28
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:21,415
What do you mean the character
needs to be more likable?

29
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,251
They don't teach likability at
the American Stanislavski Theatre.

30
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,877
Look, this is not about your acting.

31
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:28,171
You don't want an actor,
you want a blank canvas

32
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:32,426
upon which to project your own
mawkish notions of goodness.

33
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,345
Some man for all seasons
up for a bit of anything...

34
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,681
cheerful, optimistic, indomitable.

35
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,809
I assure you no such man exists.

36
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,020
But you're welcome to keep looking.

37
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,731
This D'Onofrio has had enoughfrio.

38
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:46,898
- Hah hah!
- Hmm.

39
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,318
But my favorite scenes
are when a character

40
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,144
is completely oblivious to something

41
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:52,946
really important going on behind him.

42
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,491
That, dear friends, is where
the sit truly hits the com.

43
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,452
- Excuse me.
- Kind of in the middle of something.

44
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,704
- He's yakking away, tension's building...
- Hey, you, sir.

45
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,497
... the audience is
like, "Hey, turn around."

46
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,499
Maybe the person behind
him even interrupts him...

47
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,627
- Can we talk to you for a second?
- Just like that.

48
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,828
And then, when it would
be ridiculous to go on

49
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,380
even one second longer...

50
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,299
- My name is David Chase.
- Do you mind?

51
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,052
Only then does he say, exasperated,

52
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,095
"What? What do you want?"

53
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:20,849
I want your face on billboards, you
beautiful nonsensical clown prince.

54
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,977
Doggie-doggie what now?

55
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,826
Kid, how'd you like to be the star

56
00:02:25,827 --> 00:02:29,121
of "Untitled Horsin' Around Knockoff"?

57
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:33,654
Me, a star? But I have no
experience, no formal training.

58
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,698
Hey, you, you don't
need any of those things.

59
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,950
You got "it."

60
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:41,286
Ohh...

61
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,303
Hey, BoJack, it's me again.

62
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,472
Hmm?

63
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,808
I haven't heard from you
in, like, three months,

64
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,854
so I'm calling again to
make sure you're okay.

65
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,398
What's new with me?

66
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,441
Well...

67
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:56,778
Monocle? No, I think you're
thinking of Mr. Peanut.

68
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,029
I don't know if you heard

69
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,699
but Mr. Peanutbutter is
running for governor, kind of.

70
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:04,244
I want a comprehensive crisscross
of cold calls to Contra Costa County.

71
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,163
I mean, Christ, people,
get me signatures.

72
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,249
First, they need to get Woodchuck
Coodchuck-Berkowitz recalled,

73
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,251
which is basically impossible.

74
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,837
So that actually makes it really
easy for me to be supportive.

75
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,591
- How's the recall effort?
- Stupendous!

76
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:21,344
Uh, no. We're about 4,000
signatures shy of stupendous,

77
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,846
and the deadline's in a week.

78
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,932
Even if you don't get all the
signatures, I'll still be proud of you.

79
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:26,892
Maybe even more so.

80
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,977
But when we do get the
signatures we need...

81
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,313
- please note I said "when," not "if"...
- Noted.

82
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,821
... then the campaign will begin in...

83
00:04:32,822 --> 00:04:34,941
oh, where did you say again, Katrina?

84
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,804
Earnest. When we get the signatures,

85
00:04:36,805 --> 00:04:38,445
the campaign will begin in earnest.

86
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,614
Right. Earnest, California.

87
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,658
Earnest is not a city
in Cal... Why do I try?

88
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,702
Looks like you two have
everything worked out.

89
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,163
Just please note that
I am being supportive.

90
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,080
Noted!

91
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,249
Most women wouldn't like
having their husband's ex-wife

92
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,877
hanging around all the time,
but I'm totally cool with it

93
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,171
because she makes me look
super chill by comparison.

94
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,923
Oh, uh... okay.

95
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,008
Anyway, call me back.

96
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:03,553
This is Diane, by the
way. Nguyen, obviously.

97
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,058
You sure you wouldn't
rather just play a governor

98
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,810
in a movie or TV show?

99
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,728
I could attach Tommy Schlamme to direct.

100
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,272
Tommy Schlamme, shmommy Schlamme.

101
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,399
This is bigger than all
that. Don't you recall?

102
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:19,152
- Recall what?
- The governor. We need signatures.

103
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,613
Oh, sure. Where do you
stand on the issues?

104
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,997
Oh, he doesn't stand anywhere on issues

105
00:05:23,998 --> 00:05:25,826
because he's not
running for governor yet.

106
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:29,246
I'm mainly for people right
now and also for the future.

107
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,207
Listen, I'm not feeling so hot.

108
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,668
Why don't you go get
signatures downstairs.

109
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,754
Jennifer Garner's in the lobby.
She'll sign on to anything.

110
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,090
Judah! Can I get your
John Wilkes Hancock?

111
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,471
Oh, I never developed a signature.

112
00:05:41,472 --> 00:05:43,343
I find them unnecessarily ostentatious.

113
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,303
But I can print my name legibly.

114
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,806
Thank you, Rain Man-bun.
That'll do nicely.

115
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,600
Okay.

116
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:51,893
Ralph dropped this off for you.

117
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:57,482
"I always make a beeline
to see my feline." Aww!

118
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,049
Also, you wanted me to remind you

119
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,570
about FX's American
Dead Girl miniseries.

120
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:04,948
Oh, that's right! What train wreck
are we rubbernecking at this year?

121
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,866
They're doing the Sarah Lynn story

122
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,703
and they're looking for
someone to play BoJack.

123
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,872
Oh!

124
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,375
Well, as I was saying, FX is
looking for a BoJack Horseman...

125
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,335
Ugh!

126
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,504
Horseman... Ho...

127
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:22,215
So, as we discussed earlier,

128
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,801
is this one of the moments
where you would want privacy?

129
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,223
You know what I'd do if I
had eight million dollars?

130
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,434
- Yeah, you'd give it to the waitress.
- Oh, no, no, no.

131
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,978
I mean, if I had eight
million dollars now,

132
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,648
I'd start a company that
makes remote-controlled drones.

133
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,068
But these drones have a
seat hanging from the bottom

134
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,903
so you can fly around in it.

135
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:47,657
A drone with a throne. A drone throne.

136
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,410
But if you're in it,
isn't it not a drone?

137
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,330
I feel like you're getting
really hung up on labels.

138
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,165
Well, anyways, with my
eight million dollars

139
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,668
I'm starting a new dating
app just for firemen

140
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,587
and redheaded women named Emily.

141
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,340
Aww, you don't need an
app, just hang out with me.

142
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,091
Todd, you're great.

143
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,718
What a way to end a sentence.

144
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:10,388
But I want a boyfriend
who isn't asexual.

145
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,307
Whoa. Why did you call me that?

146
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,809
No, no, it's not bad. I
didn't mean it negatively.

147
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:18,438
- I was just, like, stating it.
- I'm not... that word doesn't describe...

148
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,982
Okay, okay, I'm sorry,
whatever you call yourself,

149
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,984
you're my friend and I support you.

150
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:26,196
But sometimes labels can be helpful.

151
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,617
Wow. Well, I would label
this conversation "rough".

152
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,369
Here's the check.

153
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,580
And this cow likes getting tipped.

154
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,294
Hey, BoJack, it's me
again, voicemail number 17.

155
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,046
Did I tell you I'm working at a blog?

156
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,423
I wrote a story about an
all-girl refugee kickball league.

157
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,126
It didn't get as many
clicks as Gillian's story

158
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:48,176
about how in certain pictures

159
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,095
you can see the outline
of Chris Hemsworth's penis

160
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,722
but, you know, we're all
contributing in our own ways.

161
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,725
Anyway, it's weird
not having you around.

162
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,770
I hope you're okay, wherever you are.

163
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:07,278
"I'm so smitten with my
favorite little adult cat."

164
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,655
Oh! I love it.

165
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,115
I'm sorry I couldn't make it

166
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,159
to the Paul Blart 3: Till Death
Do Us Blart premiere last night.

167
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,494
I had a doctor's appointment.

168
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,122
- Whoa. Is everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

169
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,789
I don't like not knowing where you are,

170
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,291
especially when we live three freeways

171
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,377
and an unprotected left
turn away from each other.

172
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,380
I was thinking, what if you
move somewhere closer to me,

173
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,965
like into my house?

174
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,675
Oh. Wow!

175
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,927
Would you, could you, with a mouse?

176
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,556
I... I could, and I would,
but it's not a good time.

177
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,849
Oh, okay.

178
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,393
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, it's fine. There's no hurry.

179
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,021
- We're still young, right?
- Oh, yeah, I'm super young.

180
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,606
Blake Lively accidentally
called me Mommy yesterday,

181
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,027
but I'm sure she does that to
other young women all the time.

182
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,075
Churro-flavored waffles!

183
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,493
Huh?

184
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,543
Drone Throne.

185
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,212
Whoa, whoa!

186
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,339
Okay, Todd. Whoa!

187
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,008
Oh, God, today's the day.

188
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,260
I haven't been this nervous
since Diane was vacuuming

189
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,845
during a thunderstorm
on the Fourth of July,

190
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,139
I had to take a bath, and there
was a stranger in our yard.

191
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,808
There's no need to be nervous,
or calm for that matter

192
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,060
because you've already lost.

193
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:23,438
We're 1,600 signatures short and
the clock runs out at 9:00 AM.

194
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,398
So it's gonna take a miracle, huh?

195
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,443
Oh, no! It's over.

196
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,196
Everyone can get out of my house now.

197
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,490
Ooh, tough break, kid.
We're all in shock.

198
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,742
McG! Are you still looking for a star

199
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,130
for your transgender Teddy Roosevelt

200
00:09:37,131 --> 00:09:38,953
Planes, Trains and Automobiles reboot,

201
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,997
Plans, Trans, A Man, A Canal, Panama?

202
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,874
Because someone just became available.

203
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,250
Whoa! Whoa!

204
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,252
I don't understand what happened.

205
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,547
Let me put it in terms your
dumb dog brain can comprehend.

206
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,717
All your life people have
been throwing you bones

207
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,010
because they like you,

208
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,429
but everyone has a ceiling
to their likability.

209
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,160
This is a bone you can't have,

210
00:09:58,161 --> 00:10:01,476
because people just
don't like you enough.

211
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,106
- I'm sorry, Mr. Peanutbutter.
- You know, it's funny.

212
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:09,234
Personally I like Woodchuck
and he's a fine governor,

213
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,445
but for some reason, even though
I have zero qualifications,

214
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,948
I honestly thought I would have
made an even better governor.

215
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,576
- Well, what matters is you tried.
- But I would have been good, right?

216
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,371
Now that there's no chance
you will ever be governor,

217
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,081
I can tell you honestly...

218
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,959
Yes. You would have been great.

219
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,586
Stop. But seriously, though, elaborate.

220
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,589
You care about people,
you follow your heart.

221
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,967
Those are important qualities
you should never give up on.

222
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,136
So what you're saying
is I shouldn't give up?

223
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,805
- On those qualities.
- Yeah. Never concede.

224
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,932
- Stick it out, stay in the race.
- Uh... no...

225
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,309
Uh, maybe we should get
Katrina's two cents on this.

226
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,478
- Katrina?
- Race. That's it, Diane!

227
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,313
You diabolical Thin Mint.

228
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,060
You, and only you,

229
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:52,068
are responsible for the
great thing I am about to do.

230
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,612
Katrina?

231
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,658
Thank you, thank you.

232
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,620
Moments ago I found myself in what
seemed to be a no-win situation.

233
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,915
But it turns out it was
a "Nguyen situation."

234
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,210
I'm referring of course to my
supportive wife Diane Nguyen,

235
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:12,255
who told me to never give up!

236
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:16,134
And that's why I am challenging
Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz

237
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,137
- to a ski race down Devil's Mountain.
- What?

238
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,723
No more petitions or
fancy ballot initiatives,

239
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:25,435
just a mano a mano,
no-holds-barred slippery slalom

240
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,686
down an ice-covered peak.

241
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,480
Winner gets to be
governor, loser goes home.

242
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,524
Your move, Governor. Mic drop!

243
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,778
Aaah!

244
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,906
What the hell is he talking about?

245
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,814
It sounds like he's challenging you

246
00:11:39,815 --> 00:11:41,618
to a ski race down Devil's Mountain.

247
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,579
What an absurd conceit. Do I
even need to respond to this?

248
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,496
No, sir.

249
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,958
Because I'd rather focus on
my drought relief optimization

250
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:53,588
using geohydration
technology, or DROUGHT plan.

251
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:57,300
If I know anything, this story
will go away in a couple of days.

252
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,818
Now Mr. Peanutbutter,

253
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,972
you challenged Woodchuck
to a ski race a month ago.

254
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,934
Not just any ski race, a high-stakes
dash down Devil's Mountain

255
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,937
- for the governorship itself.
- But still no comment from the governor.

256
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,898
Why won't he race you?
That's what I want to know.

257
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,483
You and me both, friendo.

258
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:17,236
But this isn't an
us-ocracy, it's a dem-ocracy.

259
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,822
- Ooh!
- So let's ask "dem" what "dey" think.

260
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,617
Any questions for the governor, folks?

261
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,703
Why won't Woodchuck race?

262
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:30,333
So, to be clear, my DROUGHT plan
is actually a drought relief plan.

263
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,044
I see now how that's
confusing. Any other questions?

264
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,879
Are you going to race Mr. Peanutbutter?

265
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,715
Any questions about the DROUGHT plan?

266
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,426
To ski or not to ski?

267
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,929
That was the question
posed by William Shakespeare

268
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,348
and it's perhaps even
more relevant today.

269
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,810
Of course, there are reasons
why a gubernatorial election

270
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,561
should not be decided by a ski race,

271
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,022
but are there also
reasons why it should?

272
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,732
For the sake of "fairness"

273
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:57,318
we've brought in two experts
with opposite opinions

274
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,821
who will now have equal time
to just say those opinions

275
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,282
because that's what news is.

276
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,784
You think they'll really
race down Devil's Mountain?

277
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:08,329
What do I care? As long as I've
got my giant bag of kettle corn,

278
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,373
that's the only thing that concerns me.

279
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,669
- What the?
- Drone Throne strikes again! Ha ha!

280
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,170
Get back here with my kettle corn!

281
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,840
You can't call it a drone
if you're riding on it.

282
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,717
Suckers! Hooray!

283
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,176
Ha ha! Oh... oh, no!

284
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,721
Aw, man.

285
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,348
I was hoisted by my own petard,

286
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:31,185
the one petard I thought
would never hoist me.

287
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,813
Unprecedented poppycock.

288
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,773
This poppycock has no precedent.

289
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,735
Maybe it's time to make a statement.

290
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,986
Madeline, no.

291
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,697
This outlandish buffoonery is
beneath the office of the governor.

292
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,408
I can't defile the
legacy of my predecessors

293
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,661
who built the Golden Gate Bridge,
irrigated the Central Valley,

294
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,955
and played Mr. Freeze in a Batman movie.

295
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,417
Can't you see this thing
is eating you alive?

296
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,212
Do it for us, Woodcharles. Do it for us.

297
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:05,970
And so this ski race would be both
undemocratic and unconstitutional,

298
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:08,145
which is why I will not be racing

299
00:14:08,146 --> 00:14:10,892
Mr. Peanutbutter down Devil's Mountain.

300
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,770
What if the state constitution
were changed to allow it?

301
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:17,231
- Then would you race Mr. Peanutbutter?
- I...

302
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:20,651
Fine. If a state senator
wanted to waste everybody's time

303
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,363
by sponsoring an amendment
to the constitution,

304
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,948
and the motion got two-thirds
majority in both houses

305
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:29,535
so as to allow a
democratically-elected governor

306
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,705
to accept a ski race
challenge for his office,

307
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:36,459
then yes, I would race Mr. Peanutbutter.

308
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,461
Well, I guess that puts
that idea to bed, right?

309
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,588
- Hmm.
- Right?

310
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,924
- Hmm...
- Right?!

311
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,932
You want me to sponsor a ski race
amendment to the constitution?

312
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,935
Or you could sponsor the
amendment that has a hidden rider

313
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,562
doubling farm subsidies
in your district.

314
00:14:56,646 --> 00:15:00,024
- Inglewood could use some farms.
- That's right.

315
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,902
I do have these campaign
donors... uh, I mean, constituents

316
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,655
who really care about babies'
access to vaping devices.

317
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,490
Uh-huh.

318
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:11,035
I've always wanted to drive
across a bridge to Hawaii.

319
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,037
- Can we do that?
- You got it.

320
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,539
Aloha!

321
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,833
Hoo hoo hoo hoo! Whoo!

322
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,253
It tickles.

323
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,093
I'm astounded that it has come to this.

324
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,679
But since the exorbitantly expensive

325
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:34,642
and astonishingly titled I Love
California amendment is now law,

326
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:38,646
I formally accept Mr. Peanutbutter's
challenge to a ski race.

327
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,398
It happens that I'm an excellent skier

328
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,151
who won numerous medals in the
sport when I raced for Dartmouth

329
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,653
but, again, I am shocked
that fact is relevant

330
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,239
in the matter of selecting
our state's governor.

331
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:53,453
Mr. Peanutbutter, I will
see you on Devil's Mountain.

332
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,997
- Whoa!
- This is insane.

333
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,875
You could actually become
governor by winning a race.

334
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,293
Yeah. Wow.

335
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,171
You know, it's days like
this I wish I knew how to ski.

336
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,383
- You don't ski?
- Never really got into it, no.

337
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:11,554
Then why did you challenge
the governor to a ski race?

338
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,347
I didn't think it would get this far.

339
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,475
You gotta admit, this
is pretty out there.

340
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,394
Well, I guess that's it. Oh, well.
Tough break. Bye forever, Katrina.

341
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,689
No, this is not over.
This is just beginning.

342
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:25,318
Mr. Peanutbutter, you're
going to ski school.

343
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,612
Doggie-doggie what now?

344
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,780
Hey, BoJack, it's me again.

345
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:30,990
Where are you, I'm worried,

346
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,617
hope you're not dead, etc... you get it.

347
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,953
Anyway, things are even
crazier around here lately.

348
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,257
Don't know if you've seen the news,

349
00:16:37,258 --> 00:16:39,415
but I really wish you
were here for this.

350
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,460
Well, I'm off to ski school
so I can learn how to ski,

351
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,961
so I can become the governor.

352
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,421
You'd say something like,

353
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,507
"That's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard."

354
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,258
Sounds great, sweetheart.

355
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,969
But as the old saying
goes, that's politics.

356
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,639
Then you'd probably say,
"A, that's not an old saying

357
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:58,184
and, B, that's not politics!
Nothing about that is politics."

358
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,102
This is so great!

359
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,604
Then you would be so overwhelmed

360
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,773
by the unbearable
ludicrousness of the situation

361
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,108
that you would get in your
car and drive to Hawaii,

362
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,110
which is also a thing you could do now

363
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,905
because of a new bill that cost
our state billions of dollars.

364
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,615
It's all so great!

365
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:18,579
You know, it's funny, because
the last time I saw you

366
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,791
you told me that you
needed me in your life,

367
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,334
and then you just disappeared.

368
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,086
So how do you think that makes me feel?

369
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:29,382
Well, wherever you are,
I hope you're happy.

370
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,717
I really do, BoJack.

371
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,512
Also, I haven't seen Todd in a
while. He's not with you, is he?

372
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,017
Oh, simple kettle corn.

373
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:44,063
Between the worlds of
the sweet and the savory.

374
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,858
Not quite popcorn, not quite candy.

375
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,403
What are we?

376
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,446
Hey, get away! Get, get!

377
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,704
Wow, my first day at ski academy.

378
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,123
What collegiate
shenanigans will befall me?

379
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,543
There will be no
shenanigans on my watch.

380
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,877
Professor Thistlethorpe,

381
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,839
the famously humorless yet somehow
also lovable ski instructor?

382
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,593
Peanutbutter, is it? Everything
about you disgusts me.

383
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:14,510
Uh...

384
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:18,556
And yet, there might be
something in you after all.

385
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,890
You really mean it?

386
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,643
This shall be my greatest challenge.

387
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,271
Meet me on the summit
tomorrow at daybreak.

388
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,982
Well, it is daybreak and
here we are at the summit.

389
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,901
First lesson, break your skis in half.

390
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,321
Oh, I don't have skis. Was
I supposed to bring skis?

391
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,240
- You didn't say that.
- No bother. They shan't be required.

392
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:39,452
Instead, read this book of poetry.

393
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,204
I'll see you in the classroom.

394
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,833
Ah, there you are. Did you
read the book of poetry?

395
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,627
No! I forgot to.

396
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,754
- Excellent.
- I'm sor... Excellent?

397
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,631
My assignment was a test.

398
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,091
Skiing isn't about reading old books.

399
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,719
- It's about speaking truth to power...
- Oh!

400
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,305
... and you have spoken it eloquently.

401
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,350
You are my finest student.

402
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,268
I love you.

403
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,897
- Are you okay, professor?
- Just a cough.

404
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,442
I'm sure it's nothing. You can
come by tomorrow for your diploma.

405
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,280
I can't believe ski
school is already over.

406
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,699
Professor Thistlethorpe?
Professor Thistlethorpe!

407
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:22,912
Remember everything I taught you.

408
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:23,996
I will.

409
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,041
Also, if you have any tips for
skiing, that would be really helpful.

410
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,628
The most important part of skiing

411
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:35,299
is to keep your legs ben...

412
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,347
Who's Ben?

413
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,696
Devil's Mountain is the
place, skiing is the sport.

414
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,864
I'm uncomfortable. It's cold out.

415
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,325
Tell me, who do you think
will win today's bout

416
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,327
and what does it mean for
the future of California?

417
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,870
I hate winter sports.

418
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,123
I want to go inside and drink a cider.

419
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,791
And they're off!

420
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,088
Woodchuck, off to a great start.

421
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,549
Mr. Peanutbutter seems to be employing

422
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,969
some sort of awkwardly
falling down technique.

423
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,722
- Any sign of them?
- Nothing yet.

424
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,266
- Oh! I made you a card.
- You did?

425
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,810
Oh, wow, it's sparkly.

426
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,895
Sorry, I went a little
overboard with the glitter

427
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,564
and a little underboard with the glue.

428
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,692
"Let's move in together.
I think I'm ready now."

429
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,944
This is great. Are you sure, though,

430
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,697
because last time you
seemed a little hesitant.

431
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,700
- No, I was just a little pregnant.
- Oh!

432
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:43,993
I was gonna tell you, really,

433
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,787
but then before I could tell you
there was nothing to tell you.

434
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:47,997
Oh.

435
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,042
I'm so sorry. I still
wish you would've told me.

436
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,588
I have a card for that. On the
front it says, "Life isn't fairage."

437
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:59,550
I'm sorry. I just felt dumb because
all my life I've wanted a family.

438
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,511
But I didn't want it to happen just
because I got pregnant by accident

439
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,847
- and then you got stuck with me.
- Okay, first of all,

440
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,683
if I get stuck to something, you're
the prettiest glue trap I ever saw.

441
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,935
- You know what I mean.
- Second, if that's how you feel,

442
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,938
maybe you shouldn't get
pregnant by accident.

443
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,774
- Well, I didn't try to!
- No.

444
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,651
I'm saying maybe we should
get you pregnant on purpose.

445
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,069
- Really?
- Yeah.

446
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,697
We love each other, and we enjoy
having sex with each other...

447
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,574
and we're good at having
sex with each other.

448
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,535
And also, I think you'd
be an amazing mother.

449
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,872
Even Blake Lively thinks so.

450
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,916
Ah, still got it.

451
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,669
Yes!

452
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,339
Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho!

453
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:42,009
Ohh! Get control.

454
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,720
Woodchuck in the lead,
still in the lead.

455
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,264
Woodchuck remains very much in the lead.

456
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,892
Goodbye, dear friend.

457
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,811
You served me well.

458
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:54,396
Okay, all right, here we go.

459
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,565
Mr. Peanutbutter?

460
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,776
Ohh!

461
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,079
I see Woodchuck!

462
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,580
Yes!

463
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,208
Go, Woodcharles!

464
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,460
Oh... whoa... Whoa!

465
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:17,378
Oh, my God.

466
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,049
Todd forever!

467
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,759
Whaa!

468
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,345
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

469
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:30,266
Invictus!

470
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,851
Ooh! Ooh.

471
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,729
Oh... ohh.

472
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:37,898
- Did I win?
- Come on, honey.

473
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,316
Let's go home.

474
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,110
Well, I hope that settles it.

475
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,029
We can finally put an
end to this nonsense.

476
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,838
Sir, the rules are clear:

477
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,658
the first person to cross the
finish line becomes governor,

478
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,953
and, well, a strange
boy fell out of the sky

479
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,580
and crossed the line first.

480
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,164
They're swearing him in now.

481
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:57,876
- So help me Todd.
- Congratulations, Governor Chavez.

482
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,506
You know, ever since
I first became governor

483
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,800
I've thought, "I don't
want to be governor"

484
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,635
and that's where I am now.

485
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,846
So, can I not be governor?

486
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,307
You'd like to resign?

487
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,226
Yeah. I'm just really
not into labels right now.

488
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,813
Maybe after some soul searching I'll
be ready to really know what I am.

489
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:21,734
But for right now, I think
I speak for all Californians

490
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,862
when I say, "I ate too much kettle corn

491
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:29,325
while drifting through the sky on
an out of control drone throne."

492
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,328
Okay, is this charade over?
Can I be governor again?

493
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,164
Sir, we live in a society of laws.

494
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,292
When a governor resigns, that
triggers a special election.

495
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,128
Until which, the governor's
seat shall remain vacant.

496
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,422
Election, you say?

497
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,966
Mr. Peanutbutter, will you run?

498
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,886
- You bet I will, and you know why?
- No, tell me.

499
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,972
Because this whole ski race was a joke.

500
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,975
Of course Woodchuck was gonna
beat me. He went to Dartmouth.

501
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,728
So where's the candidate
for regular schmoes like me,

502
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:00,314
- who went to Northwestern?
- Is he serious right now?

503
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,025
You know, Governor
Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz

504
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,903
thinks he's better than us,
but is he better than us?

505
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,072
- No!
- Uh, if I could say a few words...

506
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,657
He thinks the race is over.

507
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,368
Well, I say it's just starting.

508
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,788
And he wants me to sit
and stay and roll over?

509
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:19,541
- No!
- I say California's tired of rolling over.

510
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,585
What do you say?

511
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,212
- Yeah!
- I'm tired.

512
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,465
I say it's time for me
to stand up and speak.

513
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,342
Diane-Diane what now?

514
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:31,136
So loud as you can, let
me hear what you want.

515
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,056
Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter!

516
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,141
- Uh, citizens...
- I can't hear you!

517
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:39,311
Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter!

518
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:40,729
Peanutbutter!

519
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:43,941
- Peanutbutter!
- Friends, some decorum, please.

520
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,820
- Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter!
- Ah!

521
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:51,448
Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter!

522
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:53,492
Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter!

523
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:58,580
- The mailbox belonging to...
- BoJack Horsemack...

524
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:02,543
- Horseman... oh, wait, how do I...
- ... is full. Goodbye.
