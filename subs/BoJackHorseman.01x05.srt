00:00:09,757 --> 00:00:12,426
Oh, is it this guy?
Never travel without it.

<i>Stop holding up the line, idiot!</i>

5
00:00:14,512 --> 00:00:16,347
It's not his fault.
He's just doing his job.

6
00:00:16,472 --> 00:00:18,015
<i>It's your fault, dummy.</i>

7
00:00:18,098 --> 00:00:20,059
I'm sorry, sir, no
liquid over three ounces.

8
00:00:20,142 --> 00:00:22,186
This is Pappy Van Winkle, friend.

9
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:25,356
Do you know how old this bourbon is?
If this was a person,

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,483
I would've stopped having
sex with it a year ago.

11
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:29,944
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Do you know who I am?

<i>Come on.</i>

13
00:00:31,738 --> 00:00:33,280
I'm actually a huge celebrity
on my way to New York

14
00:00:33,364 --> 00:00:35,616
for an important meeting
with a book publisher,

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,413
who wants to publish a book
about me because I am famous.

16
00:00:40,496 --> 00:00:41,873
- That's not...
- Fine, you want me to dance?

17
00:00:41,956 --> 00:00:42,957
I'll dance.

18
00:00:45,209 --> 00:00:46,961
Give me ten seconds, Diane.

19
00:00:47,044 --> 00:00:49,589
This guy's being a total fascist.
Diane?

20
00:00:49,672 --> 00:00:51,966
- Diane?
- Over here, BoJack.

21
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:53,593
How'd you get through so fast?

22
00:00:53,676 --> 00:00:55,219
I followed the basic
requirements for air travel

23
00:00:55,302 --> 00:00:56,637
that have been in place for over a decade.

24
00:00:56,721 --> 00:00:59,348
- Ugh, weird.
- Sir, whoever you are, please...

25
00:00:59,432 --> 00:01:01,768
Really?
You've never heard of my TV show?

26
00:01:01,851 --> 00:01:03,644
You know very well who I am.

27
00:01:03,728 --> 00:01:05,772
And now if you'll excuse
me, I'm going to New York.

28
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:07,398
<i>Ah, no.</i>

29

<i>- More?
- Come on!</i>

30
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,526
Oh, you know what?
Could be this.

31
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,194
Oh, my God, he's got a gun.

32
00:01:12,278 --> 00:01:14,447
Relax, it's a lighter.

33
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,449
How much lighter fluid
can I take on the plane?

34
00:01:16,532 --> 00:01:19,201
And before you answer,
remember, I'm a celebrity.

35
00:01:19,285 --> 00:01:21,495
We're gonna need a full body cavity search.

<i>Thanks for coming to New York for this.</i>

38

Let's just say, it's better
for everyone's kneecaps

39
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,312
if I stay out of
California for a little bit.

40
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:30,731
Always nice to get a change
of scenery, am I right?

41
00:02:30,815 --> 00:02:32,775
I think the New York air's
been good for my health.

42
00:02:32,859 --> 00:02:36,737
I mean, I did find a lump,
but hey, who needs health insurance

Horseman writing a book, huh?

How's it coming along?

45
00:02:42,368 --> 00:02:45,467
It's great. I'm pumping out
heartfelt anecdotes and witty

46
00:02:45,468 --> 00:02:49,208
observations left and right, and
this one is spinning it all into gold.

50
00:02:55,673 --> 00:02:57,466
<i>and your phone's story

51
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,761
- Excuse me. Hello?
- Hurry back, superstar.

52
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:02,304
I don't think Diane's working out.

53
00:03:02,388 --> 00:03:05,975
- What? Why? Is Diane no good?
- She's too good.

54
00:03:06,059 --> 00:03:08,519
I don't know if Diane is
damaged enough to tell my story.

55
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:10,604
She's so... functional.

56
00:03:10,688 --> 00:03:13,858
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mr. Horseman,
she's too functional.

57
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:16,986
Why don't I just get on the phone
and call a less functional...

58
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,905
What are you talking about?

59
00:03:18,988 --> 00:03:21,991
- This is a very bad time, BoJack!
- All right.

60
00:03:22,075 --> 00:03:24,459
You need to promise me that your book

61
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,954
will be on the shelves and
making money by October!

62
00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:28,622
All right. Jesus.

63
00:03:28,706 --> 00:03:29,874
<i>Uh-huh?
Uh-huh.</i>

64
00:03:29,957 --> 00:03:33,293
Uh-huh.
Got it. Sorry I took so long.

65
00:03:33,377 --> 00:03:34,837
Who was that? The library?

66
00:03:34,921 --> 00:03:37,297
Thanking you for never
returning a book late?

67
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:39,216
That was my brother Tommy.
My dad just died.

68
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:40,801
Oh, my God.

69
00:03:40,885 --> 00:03:42,302
Did we talk about firming
up the release date?

70
00:03:42,386 --> 00:03:44,179
- I was thinking late September.
- I am so sorry.

71
00:03:44,304 --> 00:03:46,015
It's fine, he was old and also the worst.

72
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:49,560
Such a terrible tragedy
really puts everything in perspective.

73
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:51,729
Where does that leave us as
far as the book of it all?

74
00:03:51,812 --> 00:03:54,398
Not a problem.
I just got to swing by Boston

75
00:03:54,481 --> 00:03:57,276
and give my condolences real quick.
BoJack can come with me.

76
00:03:57,359 --> 00:03:59,157
We'll get some work done
while we're there, and then

77
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:00,988
that way the whole trip won't
be a total waste of time.

78
00:04:01,072 --> 00:04:03,365
Great.
Call me if you need anything,

79
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:06,369
but hang up after one ring,
and I'll call you back

80
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,288

<i>and until then, don't do anything.</i>

95
00:04:47,868 --> 00:04:50,370
Well, seal's broken.
Might as well enjoy myself.

96
00:04:53,499 --> 00:04:54,834
Whee!

97
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:58,462

<i> Ohh!</i>

103
00:05:18,273 --> 00:05:22,153
Sounds like we have some fans
of Person of Interest on board,

104
00:05:22,236 --> 00:05:25,280
or Castle, or whatever his show is.

105
00:05:25,364 --> 00:05:27,741
Sorry, dudes, you got the wrong house.

106
00:05:27,825 --> 00:05:29,284
<i> Aww.</i>

107
00:05:29,368 --> 00:05:34,123
Crikey, I would've paid $50 U.S.
to see where David Boreanaz lives.

108
00:05:34,207 --> 00:05:36,083
He's the American Hugh Jackman.

109
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:38,711
<i>- Oh, yeah, 50 bucks?
- He's so good in Burn Notice.</i>

110
00:05:38,794 --> 00:05:40,546
What? 50 bucks?

111
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:42,339
In that case, come on in, friends.

112
00:05:42,422 --> 00:05:44,424
Some guy named David Boreanaz lives here.

113
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:47,386
<i> Hooray!</i>

114
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:49,013
Hey, so listen,

115
00:05:49,096 --> 00:05:50,931
I really want to be here
for you in your time of need,

116
00:05:51,015 --> 00:05:52,641
but I'm not really good
with funerals or death

117
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:54,268
or families or feelings or people.

118
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:56,103
Don't worry. You can wait in the car.

119
00:05:56,187 --> 00:05:57,771
It's probably better you
don't meet my brothers.

120
00:05:57,855 --> 00:06:00,066
They're narrow-minded,
mean-spirited dirtbags.

121
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:01,984
I wish I had brothers growing up.

122
00:06:02,068 --> 00:06:05,571
Touch football on the weekends,
noogie parades on the reg.

123
00:06:05,654 --> 00:06:08,490
Life as an only child
can get pretty lonely.

124
00:06:08,574 --> 00:06:11,577
Daddy, do you want to
meet my imaginary friend?

125
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,123
Imaginary friends are freeloaders
invented by communists to rip-off welfare.

126
00:06:16,207 --> 00:06:18,334
Why don't you do something
productive, like bang your

127
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:20,460
head against the wall until
your brain isn't so stupid?

128
00:06:20,544 --> 00:06:22,004
Okay, Daddy.

129
00:06:22,088 --> 00:06:24,649
Yeah, well, I was pretty
lonely, too. My family made my

130
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,301
life miserable, and then they
never forgave me for leaving.

131
00:06:27,384 --> 00:06:28,969
So, what, you're like the black sheep?

132
00:06:29,053 --> 00:06:30,804
No, Gary's the black sheep.
He's adopted.

133
00:06:30,888 --> 00:06:32,598
I'm just the member of
the family nobody likes.

134
00:06:32,681 --> 00:06:34,474
And my dad was the worst of them all.

135
00:06:34,558 --> 00:06:36,373
You told me that you
and your father used to

136
00:06:36,374 --> 00:06:38,229
sit on the roof and look
at the stars together.

137
00:06:38,312 --> 00:06:40,898
Oh, yeah, I was just trying
to get you to open up,

138
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:43,901
so I used an old writer's
trick called "me lying to you."

139
00:06:43,984 --> 00:06:46,070
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm using an old me trick

140
00:06:46,153 --> 00:06:47,613
called "that hurts my feelings."

141
00:06:47,696 --> 00:06:50,851
And the truth is, I used to
sit alone on the hill out by the

142
00:06:50,852 --> 00:06:54,161
dump and dream of waking up as
Chelsea Clinton, but with my hair.

143
00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:57,081
- You do have great hair.
- I know.

144
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,377
That's us.
I'll just pop in for a quick hi and bye.

145
00:07:02,461 --> 00:07:05,256
Then we'll be on our way.
Ten minutes, swear to God.

146
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:07,716
You can play with this kaleidoscope
I got you at the airport.

147
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,511
What? A kaleidoscope?
I'm not five...

148
00:07:11,595 --> 00:07:13,973
Shapes and colors the likes
of which I've never seen.

149
00:07:14,056 --> 00:07:15,849
Hello.

150
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:18,685
Hey, yeah, Deedee came home!

151
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:21,688
Gary, Marty, Artie, Deedee's back!
Come here!

152
00:07:21,772 --> 00:07:23,398
 Game. Watching the game.

153
00:07:23,482 --> 00:07:24,775
Can't look up from the game.
How you doing?

154
00:07:24,858 --> 00:07:27,861
Marty, it's a game from '86.
You've seen it a hundred times.

155
00:07:27,945 --> 00:07:29,696
And how many times does
Buckner break your heart?

156
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,240
<i>100 times.</i>

157
00:07:31,324 --> 00:07:33,159
Aw, thank
God you're here, Deedee.

158
00:07:33,242 --> 00:07:34,701
Pops is wicked departed.

159
00:07:34,785 --> 00:07:36,703
Oh, yeah, man. He departed so hard.

160
00:07:36,787 --> 00:07:38,914
And I do not like them apples, Deedee.

161
00:07:38,998 --> 00:07:40,249
Yo, Deedee, get me a beer.

162
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,541
Yeah, make that two, Deedee.

163
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,669
Gary, Marty, I just got home.

164
00:07:43,752 --> 00:07:48,341
Ooh, Princess Diane doesn't
want to get her brother a beer.

165
00:07:48,423 --> 00:07:50,843
Hey, Ma, come look what
the Pats dragged in.

166
00:07:50,926 --> 00:07:55,639
Oh, hello!
Look who decided to come home.

167
00:07:55,722 --> 00:08:00,519
Queen Deedee blesses us with her presence.
To what do I owe the honor?

168
00:08:00,602 --> 00:08:02,396
Look, I'm just here to
offer my condolences.

169
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,400
Oh, sure, in and out, like
a Protestant on Christmas.

170
00:08:06,483 --> 00:08:07,860
Why would you want to stick around,

171
00:08:07,943 --> 00:08:09,278
be with your family in their time of need?

172
00:08:09,362 --> 00:08:12,072
- Come on, Ma.
- Don't fight while the game's on.

173
00:08:12,156 --> 00:08:15,117
- It's bad Juju.
- It's the '86 World Series.

174
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:17,703
- They lose.
- Ah, why'd you have to...

175
00:08:17,786 --> 00:08:19,830
Oh, we're just a bunch of savages, right?

176
00:08:19,913 --> 00:08:22,333
We're not like your
fancy California friends.

177
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:25,919
Your George Clooney and
your California Raisins.

178
00:08:26,003 --> 00:08:28,297
Oh, come off it, Ma.
She don't mean no harm.

179
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:30,590
For five years she didn't come home.

180
00:08:30,674 --> 00:08:33,344
Why don't you make like A-Rod and blow.

181
00:08:33,427 --> 00:08:36,013
Well, this was clearly a huge mistake.

182
00:08:36,096 --> 00:08:38,932
Ah, don't go.
Deedee, please.

183
00:08:39,016 --> 00:08:40,600
Why not? Ma doesn't want me here.

184
00:08:40,684 --> 00:08:42,561
Ma don't know what she wants.

185
00:08:42,644 --> 00:08:45,480
She wants you here. We all do.
Ain't that right, Marty?

186
00:08:45,564 --> 00:08:46,732
Can't look up from the game.

187
00:08:46,815 --> 00:08:49,526
Besides, we need your help
organizing all the funeral stuff.

188
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:52,112
We didn't go to college.
We're not smart like you.

189
00:08:52,196 --> 00:08:54,823
Fine, I'll help.
Is there a number for me to call?

190
00:08:54,907 --> 00:08:57,492
Yeah, try
1-800-The-Internet, dummy.

191
00:08:57,576 --> 00:08:59,286
Jeez, do some legwork, Dee.

192
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,747
And do it quick.
The ice is melting.

193
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,749
Oh, my God. Is that dad?

194
00:09:03,832 --> 00:09:06,626
Did someone draw balls on his forehead?

195
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,421
That was before we knew he was dead.

196
00:09:08,503 --> 00:09:10,381
We just thought he was wicked hung over.

197
00:09:10,464 --> 00:09:15,469
 In your face, Dad!
In your face forever.

198
00:09:15,552 --> 00:09:19,932
<i>Welcome to the
home of David Boreanaz,</i>

199
00:09:20,015 --> 00:09:21,767
famous from television shows

200
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,063
such as dramas on networks.

201
00:09:26,146 --> 00:09:27,898
That will be $50 please.

202
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:31,360
Oy, mate, this picture of
David Boreanaz fell apart.

203
00:09:31,444 --> 00:09:33,900
Oh, no, no, no, I'll handle
that. Why don't you just

204
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:36,449
go look through David Boreanaz's
underwear drawer, okay?

205
00:09:36,531 --> 00:09:39,201
- It's in his bedroom.
- Oh, knickers.

206
00:09:39,285 --> 00:09:40,869
<i> Hey, what do
you think you're doing?</i>

207
00:09:40,953 --> 00:09:42,829
Uh-oh, am I reading something again?

208
00:09:42,913 --> 00:09:45,458
<i>No, this is your conscience.</i>

209
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,043
<i>BoJack trusted you to
take care of his house.</i>

210
00:09:48,127 --> 00:09:50,337
<i>Is this really... What are you doing?</i>

211
00:09:54,716 --> 00:09:56,135
<i>♪ Dun-dun-dun-dun ♪</i>

212
00:09:56,218 --> 00:09:57,594
<i>♪ Dun-dun-dun... ♪</i>

213
00:09:57,677 --> 00:10:01,181
It's a great day on Todd's phone.
How can I help you?

214
00:10:01,265 --> 00:10:02,891
Are you trying to cut me out
of this David Boreanaz deal?

215
00:10:02,975 --> 00:10:04,435
I'm your agent, damn it.

216
00:10:04,518 --> 00:10:06,312
How'd you find out about Boreanaz House?

217
00:10:06,395 --> 00:10:08,188
Don't worry, I'm not just gonna sit here

218
00:10:08,272 --> 00:10:10,274
batting a ball of yarn around
while you do the real work.

219
00:10:10,357 --> 00:10:13,319
I want to take your
project to the next level.

220
00:10:13,402 --> 00:10:15,112
We need to go bigger.

221
00:10:15,195 --> 00:10:17,364
Have you thought about attaching
Mila Kunis to this thing?

222
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:21,535
- Attach her? How?
- You do your job. I'll do mine.

223
00:10:21,618 --> 00:10:23,662
Who is this?

224
00:10:25,247 --> 00:10:27,500
Ah, out of combinations.
Now I'm bored.

225
00:10:27,582 --> 00:10:29,918
Diaaaaane!

226
00:10:31,753 --> 00:10:33,339
- You show me nothing...
- What do you want from me?

227
00:10:33,422 --> 00:10:35,341
You have no right to barge
in here after five years

228
00:10:35,424 --> 00:10:39,094
- and judge us, Diane.
- I'm just saying Marty could lend a hand

229
00:10:39,178 --> 00:10:41,096
instead of sitting on the
couch watching the game all day.

230
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,017
- Ah, Deedee.
- You know very well his leg's still sore

231
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,768
from the accident at the quarry.

232
00:10:46,852 --> 00:10:49,938
Yeah, he's got to rest up if he's
gonna be a wide receiver for B.C.

233
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:51,773
He didn't get into B.C.

234
00:10:51,857 --> 00:10:53,775
Ah, what's the point of
getting off the couch anyway?

235
00:10:53,859 --> 00:10:55,944
All the jobs are going
to immigrants these days.

236
00:10:56,028 --> 00:10:57,946
What do you... We're immigrants.

237
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,948
- How do you figure?
- We're Vietnamese?

238
00:11:00,032 --> 00:11:02,409
Step off! We're American as fuck.

239
00:11:02,493 --> 00:11:03,910
<i>And that's the same crap you always pull...</i>

240
00:11:03,994 --> 00:11:06,872
<i>What do you want from me?
Come on!</i>

241
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:09,875
Excuse me.
Yes, hello, I'm looking for Diane.

242
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,544
Does anyone here speak English?

243
00:11:11,626 --> 00:11:14,046
Pull over and park the car.

244
00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:16,923
Is that the frickin'
horse from Horsin' Around?

245
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:19,759
Again, does anyone here speak English?

246
00:11:19,843 --> 00:11:23,472
- Oh, no way...
- What? A TV star!

247
00:11:25,849 --> 00:11:27,059
Boreanaz house.

248
00:11:27,142 --> 00:11:29,436
Seventy-five each.
Children and seniors free.

249
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,885
Please stay behind
the ropes and keep your

250
00:11:31,886 --> 00:11:34,525
hands and belongings on
your person at all times.

251
00:11:34,608 --> 00:11:37,319
Next we'll head to the kitchen where...
Is that Mila Kunis?

252
00:11:37,403 --> 00:11:38,945
<i>Ooh!</i>

253
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:41,781
Note the letters B.H. on
all hand towels and linens.

254
00:11:41,865 --> 00:11:43,867
That stands for "Boreanaz House."

255
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:50,290
Yeah, do you pick up bodies?

256
00:11:50,374 --> 00:11:52,376
Is that a service you provide?
Corpse removal?

257
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:55,754
Hey, BoJack, you ever meet
any Boston celebrities?

258
00:11:55,837 --> 00:11:57,631
Well, one time at Bristol Farms,

259
00:11:57,714 --> 00:12:00,717
Ben Affleck and I did reach
for the same bunch of grapes.

260
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,389
Oh, he eats grapes just like us?
Hey, Ma, Ben Affleck eats grapes!

261
00:12:05,472 --> 00:12:07,057
<i> He don't eat grapes!</i>

262
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,768
BoJack said he fed Affleck grapes.

263
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:12,104
He was graping it up with
the Daredevil himself.

264
00:12:12,187 --> 00:12:16,316
- This is the greatest day of my life.
- Oh!

265
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,237
Hey, I don't suppose
you boys would have any

266
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,320
interest in maybe playing
some touch football later?

267
00:12:20,404 --> 00:12:23,115
Are you kidding?
Touch football with a star like you?

268
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:25,158
That would be mad wicked pisser.

269
00:12:25,242 --> 00:12:26,701
Ooh, you know what else we got to do?

270
00:12:26,785 --> 00:12:29,663
We got to watch the Cryane video.

271
00:12:29,746 --> 00:12:31,290
Ooh, that sounds good. 
What's that?

272
00:12:31,373 --> 00:12:34,418
- No, we don't need to revisit that.
- When Deedee was 16,

273
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:37,170
we made up a secret pen pal
for her named Leo.

274
00:12:37,254 --> 00:12:40,549
Guys, I really would rather not discuss it.

275
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:42,468
We all took turns writing her letters,

276
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:45,720
pretending to be this
sensitive boy from Cambridge.

277
00:12:45,804 --> 00:12:47,473
It was wicked messed up.

278
00:12:47,556 --> 00:12:50,850
"Oh, Diane, we're two misunderstood souls.

279
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:55,230
Everyone else is a phony.
Yours forever, Leo."

280
00:12:55,314 --> 00:12:59,318
- What? That is amazing.
- After six months of letters,

281
00:12:59,401 --> 00:13:01,820
we hired a homeless
guy to pretend to be Leo

282
00:13:01,903 --> 00:13:04,364
and take her to the homecoming dance.

283
00:13:04,448 --> 00:13:05,782
- Look at her.
- Watch, watch this part.

284
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:08,992
<i>I like your boutonniÃ¨re.</i>

285
00:13:09,027 --> 00:13:12,372
<i>Why don't we watch this every day?</i>

286
00:13:12,456 --> 00:13:13,748
- Look at her face.
- Now that's a good prank.

287
00:13:13,832 --> 00:13:16,585
- I was humiliated.
- Yeah, you wouldn't get it.

288
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:18,420
It's a brothers thing, right, brothers?

289
00:13:18,504 --> 00:13:21,840
Whoo! That's Cryane for you.
What a pussy.

290
00:13:21,923 --> 00:13:25,093
You know, it's nice that years later
we can all laugh about this.

291
00:13:25,177 --> 00:13:27,012
Yep, my therapist thinks the same thing.

292
00:13:27,095 --> 00:13:28,972
I'm gonna go meet with
the funeral director.

293
00:13:29,055 --> 00:13:30,641
Any of you boys want to come?

294
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:32,559
Nah, I ain't so big on
funeral homes, Deedee.

295
00:13:32,643 --> 00:13:34,186
All them dead bodies,
they give me the jeebies.

296
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:36,730
Yeah, Deedee, why do we got to go?

297
00:13:36,813 --> 00:13:40,233
Fine, none of you have to go.
I'll take care of everything.

298
00:13:40,317 --> 00:13:42,068
Thank you, Diane.
We all really appreciate it.

299
00:13:42,152 --> 00:13:45,374
- Come on, BoJack.
- Why you got to take BoJack with you?!

300
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:46,198
Boo!

301
00:13:46,281 --> 00:13:48,701
- Boo!
- Boys, you have stolen my heart

302
00:13:48,783 --> 00:13:50,452
like Dave Roberts stole second base.

303
00:13:50,536 --> 00:13:52,663
Hey! He knows our things!

304
00:13:52,746 --> 00:13:55,207
I must go now, but I'll see
you all at the funeral, okay?

305
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,751
And when I do, you're all getting noogies.

306
00:13:57,834 --> 00:13:58,835
- Funeral!
- Yeah!

307
00:13:58,918 --> 00:13:59,919
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

308
00:14:00,003 --> 00:14:01,129
<i> Funeral!</i>

309
00:14:01,213 --> 00:14:02,422
<i>Funeral! Funeral!</i>

310
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,220
And now, a very special treat
just for our platinum members.

311
00:14:08,303 --> 00:14:14,226
Let's take a peek at the slumbering
Mr. Boreanaz himself.

312
00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:17,896
<i>Get out of my room, Todd!
I'm David Boreanaz.</i>

313
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:19,523
<i> Ohh!</i>

314
00:14:19,606 --> 00:14:21,066
And thus concludes our tour.

315
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:22,901
Have a Boreanderful day.

316
00:14:24,986 --> 00:14:27,239
Tell me about your father.

317
00:14:27,322 --> 00:14:30,941
Well, he was a mean, sadistic
alcoholic, who never supported

318
00:14:30,942 --> 00:14:34,204
anything I did and actively
delighted in seeing me fail.

319
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:38,041
Hmm, I see.
Sounds like you're looking for

320
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:39,834
our Piece of Shit Dad Package.

321
00:14:39,918 --> 00:14:41,754
That would be too good for my father.

322
00:14:41,836 --> 00:14:45,162
Hmm, I see.
Might I then suggest our

323
00:14:45,163 --> 00:14:49,135
Piece of Shit Dad Package
Would Be Too Good For Him Package.

324
00:14:49,219 --> 00:14:52,972
- Yeah, that's the one.
- Excellent choice.

325
00:14:53,056 --> 00:14:55,016
Hey, can I suggest something?

326
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,269
You might want to loosen up a little.

327
00:14:57,352 --> 00:14:59,104
I think you could actually
learn a thing or two

328
00:14:59,187 --> 00:15:01,898
- from your brothers.
- Are you kidding?

329
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:04,025
If I was like my brothers,
nothing would ever get done.

330
00:15:04,109 --> 00:15:07,188
I'm just saying, if you
can't find a way to let off

331
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:10,031
some steam you're going to explode.

332
00:15:10,115 --> 00:15:11,866
<i>God damn it!
Are you god damn kidding me?</i>

333
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,452
I keep getting calls
from this unlisted number.

334
00:15:13,535 --> 00:15:15,370
Ignore. Who are these assholes?

335
00:15:15,454 --> 00:15:17,080
Why don't you just answer,
and then you'll know?

336
00:15:17,163 --> 00:15:18,791
Oh, they'd just love that, wouldn't they?

337
00:15:18,873 --> 00:15:22,252
Ugh, how are we supposed to
blackmail him if we can't reach him?

338
00:15:22,335 --> 00:15:24,713
Maybe we got to get him where he lives?

339
00:15:24,797 --> 00:15:29,134
- You mean... ?
- That's right, his house.

340
00:15:30,469 --> 00:15:32,011
<i>What the... Whose house is this?</i>

341
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,180
Is that David Boreanaz?

342
00:15:34,264 --> 00:15:37,100
I could've sworn BoJack
Horseman lived here.

343
00:15:37,183 --> 00:15:38,769
Hey, let's keep these lines moving, huh?

344
00:15:38,852 --> 00:15:42,147
You want to stop and chat, you gotta
pay for the extended stay ticket.

345
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,149
Ah, so much, so much, so much.

346
00:15:44,232 --> 00:15:47,235
Another five Gs, T-Bag,
and we are in the pink.

347
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:48,737
I don't know, Princess Carolyn.

348
00:15:48,821 --> 00:15:52,407
I ran out of shoeboxes for the money,
and the books aren't adding up.

349
00:15:52,491 --> 00:15:55,392
Plus the men's lav needs
to be serviced, and I had to

350
00:15:55,393 --> 00:15:58,455
fire Janine in the gift shop
for stealing Boreabble heads.

351
00:15:58,538 --> 00:16:01,249
I mean, how did I end up
with all this responsibility?

352
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,460
Hey, I'm not screwing
around here, small fry.

353
00:16:03,543 --> 00:16:07,020
- You better make those numbers sing.
- I don't think these offshore

354
00:16:07,021 --> 00:16:09,716
banks we've been using
are 100% legal.

355
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,177
Yeah, well, my mother told
me never to slap an idiot.

356
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,553
What? Ow!

357
00:16:13,637 --> 00:16:15,555
Now we're both breaking the rules.

358
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:18,375
You listen, and you listen
good. I've gotten used to

359
00:16:18,376 --> 00:16:21,060
a certain lifestyle since
Boreanaz House went public,

360
00:16:21,144 --> 00:16:22,729
and I'm not going back to the old way.

361
00:16:22,813 --> 00:16:25,607
Mommy likes her shoes, see?
And her pearls.

362
00:16:25,691 --> 00:16:28,943
Oh, I'm in too deep.
I don't know what to do.

363
00:16:29,027 --> 00:16:30,487
<i>I'll tell you what you should do.</i>

364
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,655
Who said that?

365
00:16:31,738 --> 00:16:33,198
<i>It's me, David Boreanaz.</i>

366
00:16:33,281 --> 00:16:35,534
Is that what David Boreanaz sounds like?

367
00:16:35,617 --> 00:16:38,662
<i>Uh, sure.
Let me give you some advice.</i>

368
00:16:38,745 --> 00:16:41,874
<i>As we say on my show...
I want to say, New Girl?...</i>

369
00:16:41,956 --> 00:16:44,292
<i>just keep doing what you're
doing, and you'll be fine.</i>

370
00:16:44,376 --> 00:16:46,461
Wow, thanks, Davie B.

371
00:16:46,545 --> 00:16:49,381
<i>Never call me that!</i>

372
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,887
- Unbelievable.
- It's 4:00. I don't think anyone's coming.

373
00:16:54,969 --> 00:16:57,639
Unbe-goddamn-lievable!

374
00:16:57,723 --> 00:17:02,143
All those jerk wads had to do was show up,
and they couldn't even do that!

375
00:17:02,227 --> 00:17:03,603
Where's the body even?

376
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:05,939
Beg your pardon, minor hiccup.

377
00:17:06,022 --> 00:17:10,235
My goons went to pick your
father up, but nobody was home.

378
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,446
For a nominal fee, we can
scrounge up another body for you.

379
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,576
Would you care to peruse our loaner closet?

380
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:22,455
Hey, assholes! Where were you?

381
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:24,833
I planned the whole funeral,
like you asked me to,

382
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:28,176
- and nobody showed.
- Yeah, we realized dad wouldn't

383
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:29,963
have wanted some stuffy funeral.

384
00:17:30,046 --> 00:17:32,215
He would've wanted his body
to be chopped up into chum

385
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:35,928
- and thrown in Derek Jeter's fat face.
- Yeah, suck it, Jeter!

386
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,679
Wait, what? Where is Dad?

387
00:17:37,763 --> 00:17:39,431
We got him chummed. He's in the truck.

388
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:45,771
- You chummed Dad?
- It's what your father wanted, honey,

389
00:17:45,854 --> 00:17:48,732
but then you wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

390
00:17:48,815 --> 00:17:51,610
Let me get this straight.
So instead of coming to the funeral

391
00:17:51,693 --> 00:17:54,654
that I paid for and
spent all day organizing,

392
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:57,783
you had Dad's body ground into chum,

393
00:17:57,866 --> 00:18:01,202
so you could throw his
mushy remains on Derek Jeter?

394
00:18:01,286 --> 00:18:05,540
No, not just on Derek Jeter.
We're gonna throw it into his fat face.

395
00:18:05,624 --> 00:18:07,041
- Yeah, his fat face.
- In his fat face.

396
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,460
The Yankees are in town this week.

397
00:18:08,543 --> 00:18:09,878
The planets are aligning, Deedee.

398
00:18:09,962 --> 00:18:12,464
Tommy, you begged me to stay and help.

399
00:18:12,547 --> 00:18:15,926
Why does everything always
got to be about big-shot Diane?

400
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:20,388
- Too good for her home.
- I don't think I'm too good for my home.

401
00:18:20,472 --> 00:18:22,390
Yeah, guys, you got it all wrong.

402
00:18:22,474 --> 00:18:25,811
Diane isn't a big-shot.
She's my ghostwriter.

403
00:18:25,894 --> 00:18:29,439
She's writing a book that's not
even gonna have her name on it.

404
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:32,818
You think this is how she expected
her life would be going at 34?

405
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:35,988
She lives with her rich
boyfriend and doesn't pay rent.

406
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,574
She's not too good for anything.

407
00:18:39,658 --> 00:18:42,243
- What?
- Diane's a freeloader?

408
00:18:43,453 --> 00:18:47,457
- Even I pay rent.
- BoJack helping?

409
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:53,964
Whoa.

410
00:18:54,047 --> 00:18:58,718
This is why I told you to wait in the car!

411
00:18:58,802 --> 00:19:01,346
Oh, she snapped.
Here comes Cryane.

412
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:04,057
Hey, hey, Deedee, come on.

413
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,102
Diane, you are making a
public spectacle of yourself.

414
00:19:08,186 --> 00:19:10,647
Deedee, what are you doing with Dad's keys?

415
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,148
Put those back.

416
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:13,650
Oh, come on, that's Dad's truck.

417
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:15,068
Dad's chum is in the back.

418
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:16,653
No! No, no, no!

419
00:19:16,736 --> 00:19:19,113
<i> Suck a dick, dumb shits!</i>

420
00:19:19,197 --> 00:19:21,783
Well, that crazy clam did it.
She took Pops.

421
00:19:21,867 --> 00:19:25,095
Oh, no, what are we gonna do?

422
00:19:25,578 --> 00:19:27,330
<i>And it's a
one-hopper back to the pitcher.</i>

423
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:31,084
Easy out at first.
So what we're gonna do is nothing?

424
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:33,211
Sox are on, and I haven't seen this one.

425
00:19:33,294 --> 00:19:35,213
Does anyone know where
she might have gone?

426
00:19:35,296 --> 00:19:37,090
Ah, she used to run off
like this all the time

427
00:19:37,173 --> 00:19:40,468
in high school, too.
Who knows where crazy goes?

428
00:19:40,552 --> 00:19:42,762
I think I know where she went.

429
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:46,058
Wait, you can't leave.
The party's just getting started.

430
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,476
I don't know, Diane was pretty upset,

431
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,355
- and she's got your dad.
- Oh, don't go, BoJack.

432
00:19:52,438 --> 00:19:53,940
You're like the fifth brother I never had.

433
00:19:54,024 --> 00:19:56,651
- I... Really?
- Yeah, don't leave, bro.

434
00:19:56,735 --> 00:19:59,779
After this, we'll go play touch football
and do a noogie parade.

435
00:19:59,863 --> 00:20:02,240
Ah, um...

436
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:04,534
<i>Everyone please disperse.</i>

437
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:08,538
<i>This is an unlawful gathering.
Disperse immediately.</i>

438
00:20:10,373 --> 00:20:12,084
Oh, this isn't looking
good, Princess Carolyn.

439
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,961
- What are we gonna do?
- What do you mean, we?

440
00:20:15,045 --> 00:20:17,589
Princess Carolyn always lands on her feet.

441
00:20:17,672 --> 00:20:18,673
Ha!

442
00:20:18,757 --> 00:20:20,466
Mr. Boreanaz, I presume.

443
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:24,012
Um, would you like a Boreabble head?

444
00:20:24,096 --> 00:20:27,766
The amazing thing is, the house
looks just like BoJack's house.

445
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:29,642
They must have the same architect.

446
00:20:29,726 --> 00:20:31,269
Anyway, how are things with you?

447
00:20:31,352 --> 00:20:32,812
<i> Not good.</i>

448
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:35,398
<i>I should've known it was a
waste of time to come back here.</i>

449
00:20:35,481 --> 00:20:38,401
Oh, that's awful.
Well, when you get back,

450
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:40,403
I'll give you one of my
patented Peanutbutter hugs.

451
00:20:40,486 --> 00:20:42,321
Crunchy and creamy.

452
00:20:42,405 --> 00:20:45,992
You know that patent wasn't
approved, but I'll take it.

453
00:20:46,076 --> 00:20:50,122
<i>- I have to go. BoJack's here.
- BoJack, well, what's he doing... ?</i>

454
00:20:50,204 --> 00:20:53,750
Hey.
Sorry I said all that stuff about you.

455
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,961
It's all true, isn't it?

456
00:20:56,044 --> 00:20:59,756
I found this letter back at the bar.
I think it's for you.

457
00:21:01,674 --> 00:21:03,551
Look, just read it.
I think you'll like it.

458
00:21:03,635 --> 00:21:08,347
"Dear Diane, it's me, your old pen pal Leo.

459
00:21:08,431 --> 00:21:11,517
This definitely isn't BoJack
Horseman writing this."

460
00:21:11,601 --> 00:21:12,811
Keep reading.

461
00:21:12,894 --> 00:21:14,813
"You're a good person, Diane,

462
00:21:14,896 --> 00:21:17,107
and that's the most important thing.

463
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,900
Even if no one appreciates you,

464
00:21:18,984 --> 00:21:21,569
it's important that you
don't stop being good.

465
00:21:21,653 --> 00:21:24,948
I like how you always bring your
own bags to the grocery store,

466
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:27,659
and how you're always
organized to go places.

467
00:21:27,742 --> 00:21:31,704
I like how you chew gum on the
airplane so your ears will pop.

468
00:21:31,788 --> 00:21:34,707
A lot of people might not
appreciate that about you,

469
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:38,377
but I do.
Yours forever, Leo."

470
00:21:38,461 --> 00:21:40,964
That's the best letter he ever wrote me.

471
00:21:41,047 --> 00:21:44,050
Look, take it from someone
with his own shitty parents,

472
00:21:44,134 --> 00:21:45,927
family is a sinkhole,

473
00:21:46,011 --> 00:21:48,096
and you were right to get
out when you had the chance.

474
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,732
The stupid thing is,
even now I still just want

475
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:53,018
them to be proud of me
and think I did good.

476
00:21:53,101 --> 00:21:54,894
Is that really stupid?

477
00:21:54,978 --> 00:21:56,188
- Yep.
- No, it isn't.

478
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:59,482
Yeah, it is.
You want those guys to be proud of you?

479
00:21:59,565 --> 00:22:01,776
I guess I was just hoping to
get some modicum of closure.

480
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,571
Closure is a made up thing
by Steven Spielberg to sell movie tickets.

481
00:22:05,655 --> 00:22:09,742
It, like true love and the Munich Olympics,
doesn't exist in the real world.

482
00:22:09,826 --> 00:22:13,371
The only thing to do now is
just to keep living forward.

483
00:22:13,454 --> 00:22:15,915
Yeah, but every time
I come back here they...

484
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:19,252
So don't come back here.
What's great about Los Angeles

485
00:22:19,335 --> 00:22:21,880
is nobody cares about where
you're from or who you are.

486
00:22:21,963 --> 00:22:24,883
It's a superficial town
where you can worry about stupid shit

487
00:22:24,966 --> 00:22:26,425
like keeping your pool clean,

488
00:22:26,509 --> 00:22:28,220
and what artisanal nuts
to put on your salad.

489
00:22:28,302 --> 00:22:31,139
- I do like salad.
- Oh, it's the best.

490
00:22:31,223 --> 00:22:34,600
- Why do you think people keep moving there?
- Thanks, BoJack.

491
00:22:34,684 --> 00:22:38,897
The good news is, your dad
can't hurt anyone ever again.

492
00:22:40,481 --> 00:22:42,441
Uh-oh.

I thought a big baseball hotshot like you

497
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:59,709
would be too busy to help us
old ladies across the street.

498
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:02,378
I always have time to
look out for my elders,

499
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:04,422
Yankee fan or no.

You know what to do.

Hey, Herb, look, I think we
have some unfinished business.

507
00:23:29,405 --> 00:23:31,908
It seems like life's
too short to hold grudges

508
00:23:31,991 --> 00:23:34,286
and stuff like that,
you know what I'm saying?

509
00:23:34,368 --> 00:23:36,996
About life being too short?
Well, of course you know what I'm saying.

I feel like I'm doing all the talking here.

00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:42,335

Why don't you give me a call, okay?

Obviously.

515
00:23:52,971 --> 00:23:55,974
Ugh, who keeps calling me?

516
00:23:56,057 --> 00:23:59,560
Come on, BoJack.
Pick up, pick up.

517
00:23:59,644 --> 00:24:01,062
I'm sure he'll pick up.
