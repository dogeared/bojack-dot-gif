1
00:00:14,282 --> 00:00:16,908
Look alive, bright eyes.

2
00:00:16,909 --> 00:00:18,994
It's the morning and somebody loves you.

3
00:00:18,995 --> 00:00:20,555
Right back at you, buddy.

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,331
- Oh, my God. He's here.
- There he is.

5
00:00:22,332 --> 00:00:26,043
- I love you, Mr. Peanutbutter.
- I love you, too.

6
00:00:26,044 --> 00:00:31,507
Idea for a new Pixar movie:
what are pizza boxes thinking about?

7
00:00:31,508 --> 00:00:34,343
- And Leland Stanford?
- Transcontinental Railroad.

8
00:00:34,344 --> 00:00:36,488
- Transcontinental Railroad?
- That is correct.

9
00:00:36,513 --> 00:00:40,765
Next question,
what is my favorite kind of berry?

10
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:43,185
- Barry Bostwick.
- Raspberry?

11
00:00:43,186 --> 00:00:46,230
I'm so sorry, the correct answer,
of course, was Barry Bostwick.

12
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:48,899
- How was I supposed to know?
- He also likes Franken Berry.

13
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,235
- We would have accepted Franken Berry.
- What?

14
00:00:51,236 --> 00:00:53,571
- I'm sorry, you lose.
- What the...?

15
00:00:53,572 --> 00:00:56,865
That's our show, but before we go
I wanna send out a quick message.

16
00:00:56,866 --> 00:01:02,787
Diane, if you're watching this, I love you
and I know you're doing great things.

17
00:01:02,788 --> 00:01:08,460
Idea for a new app: an undo button
that could undo long amounts of time.

18
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:15,133
- Hey, is everyone having a good time? Ha!
- Three months. A year. A life.

19
00:01:15,134 --> 00:01:20,239
Erica, where did that tooth come from?
All right, let's keep this party going.

20
00:01:20,265 --> 00:01:23,909
One click and everything could
just go back to the way it was.

21
00:01:28,773 --> 00:01:31,483
- Hey.
- Hey.

22
00:01:31,484 --> 00:01:36,464
- You're still here?
- Yup. Still here.

23
00:02:36,716 --> 00:02:39,217
- Stop it.
- Wake up, captain dumbshit.

24
00:02:39,218 --> 00:02:42,071
I've been trying to get in touch
with you for two months.

25
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:44,865
Ow. Okay. I'm awake, I'm awake.

26
00:02:45,558 --> 00:02:47,142
Aah! What is it?

27
00:02:47,143 --> 00:02:52,230
If the studio wants to sue me, tell them
to take my house. I belong to the sea now.

28
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:55,859
- Are you drunk?
- Only on adventure. And gin.

29
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,486
And vodka. And gin.

30
00:02:57,487 --> 00:03:00,280
They're not gonna sue you.
They finished the movie.

31
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:04,201
- What? How? Explain yourself, land wench.
- I don't know, ask Turteltaub.

32
00:03:04,202 --> 00:03:07,204
That's not why I'm here.
I thought you were in Cordovia.

33
00:03:07,205 --> 00:03:08,830
You've been here this whole time?

34
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:13,585
Idea for a thing Princess Carolyn
should do... Shut up.

35
00:03:13,586 --> 00:03:15,379
Get dressed.
We're going to the orphanage.

36
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,505
What orphanage?

37
00:03:16,506 --> 00:03:19,550
Remember at Herb's funeral,
I asked you what you wanted me to do

38
00:03:19,551 --> 00:03:22,862
- with your Horsin' Around residuals?
- I do... not remember that.

39
00:03:22,887 --> 00:03:25,263
You said, "Give it to an orphanage
or something."

40
00:03:25,264 --> 00:03:27,849
- What?
- It turns out you made enough money

41
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,354
to build a brand new one.
So congratulations. You're a hero.

42
00:03:32,355 --> 00:03:33,914
A hero?

43
00:03:34,524 --> 00:03:36,816
That's right, a hero.

44
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:39,277
Or is it pronounced "gyro?"
I just call them subs.

45
00:03:39,278 --> 00:03:42,531
Anyway, enjoy the sandwich,
you're a great man.

46
00:03:42,532 --> 00:03:45,701
Welcome to
The BoJack Horseman Orphanage.

47
00:03:45,702 --> 00:03:48,620
Or, as we call it,
The BoJack Horsephanage.

48
00:03:48,621 --> 00:03:50,121
You cannot call it that.

49
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:54,918
A, because I am not a great man and B,
because that is a really stupid name.

50
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:59,047
- The name was Molly's idea.
- Stop pissing off the orphans.

51
00:03:59,048 --> 00:04:01,759
A lot of them grow up
to be serial killers.

52
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,777
Thank you for that lovely song.
But I'm not a good person.

53
00:04:19,778 --> 00:04:23,280
This is the only good thing I've ever done
and I did it by accident.

54
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:26,199
And it just goes to show you
life is just... Ah, what am I saying?

55
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,036
I don't have to tell you how hard life is.
You're the ones with the dead parents.

56
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:32,997
- My parents are dead?
- No. No. Not necessarily.

57
00:04:32,998 --> 00:04:35,041
Maybe they just didn't want you.

58
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:39,254
My point is,
I don't understand how people live.

59
00:04:39,255 --> 00:04:41,715
It's amazing to me that people
wake up every morning

60
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:46,529
and say, "Yeah, another day, let's do it."
How do people do it?

61
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:47,906
I don't know how.

62
00:04:48,473 --> 00:04:50,157
Yay.

63
00:04:57,231 --> 00:05:02,611
So you see, Todd, the nimble improviser
must navigate the most sensitive of areas.

64
00:05:02,612 --> 00:05:05,363
- And I'm not just talking about the butt.
- Ha.

65
00:05:05,364 --> 00:05:09,576
Copernicus, how do you always come
up with these amazing butt jokes?

66
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:13,913
When you're a Level Nine, as I am,
you don't come up with butt jokes.

67
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:18,084
You live truthfully in the moment
and the butt joke comes to you.

68
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:20,170
So true. So wise.

69
00:05:20,171 --> 00:05:23,381
Listen, I need to "shove off,"
as we sailors say,

70
00:05:23,382 --> 00:05:27,260
on my comedy cruise line, the Giggleship.
I shan't be returning.

71
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:28,696
- Shan't you?
- I shannot.

72
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:32,390
I'd like you to join me on the high seas,
as my Number Two

73
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:35,268
and I don't mean that kind of number two.

74
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:38,414
What, number two, how do you do that?

75
00:05:40,817 --> 00:05:44,486
If it isn't the furshlugginer putz
who cost me 50 grand.

76
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:47,781
I'm sorry I bailed in the middle of
production. If there's anything I can do.

77
00:05:47,782 --> 00:05:49,700
Do? What do? Movie's finished.

78
00:05:49,701 --> 00:05:51,910
- We fixed the whole thing in post.
- Really?

79
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:55,372
Remember your first week, these nerds
made a computer scan of your head

80
00:05:55,373 --> 00:05:57,290
so we could finish
if something happened?

81
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,876
Please don't call us nerds, sir.

82
00:05:58,877 --> 00:06:01,920
Something happened to you,
so these nerds finished the movie.

83
00:06:01,921 --> 00:06:04,464
Look what Computer BoJack can do.

84
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:07,384
- Help you out of that tree, ma'am?
- Look at him save that cat.

85
00:06:07,385 --> 00:06:09,427
Now there's a protagonist
we can root for.

86
00:06:09,428 --> 00:06:11,823
- You did all that in the computer?
- Not just that.

87
00:06:11,848 --> 00:06:16,434
Computer BoJack had so much charisma
and screen presence we ended up going back

88
00:06:16,435 --> 00:06:19,563
- and replacing you in every scene.
- I'm not in the movie at all?

89
00:06:19,564 --> 00:06:23,316
Not technically, but computer you
is giving the performance of your career.

90
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:25,360
When people see what you do in this movie,

91
00:06:25,361 --> 00:06:27,529
they are gonna storm
Daniel Day-Lewis's house,

92
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,114
schlep him out into the street,
shoot him in the head.

93
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:31,909
That's how good your performance is.

94
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,160
It's gonna make Daniel Day-Lewis
look like shit.

95
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:37,414
- They're gonna hate Daniel Day-Lewis.
- But it's not my performance.

96
00:06:37,415 --> 00:06:41,084
Explain that the widow Day-Lewis.
She'll be devastated. Kaput. Kapleshky.

97
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:44,379
Are you Jewish? Because I feel
some of these you're just making up.

98
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,423
We got a screening this weekend.

99
00:06:46,424 --> 00:06:49,551
Come see the movie,
we'll schmooze, we'll kibitz,

100
00:06:49,552 --> 00:06:51,946
schlemiel, schlimazel,
Hasenpfeffer Incorporated.

101
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:58,309
Just think, Carolyn,
in one week, all of this will be ours.

102
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,938
We should a put a social-media desk there.

103
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:03,857
If we hire someone to micromanage
our clients' online personas

104
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:06,985
and new media outreach, they'll seem
more grounded down to earth.

105
00:07:06,986 --> 00:07:09,905
Smiling poop emoji,
I love everything about that.

106
00:07:09,906 --> 00:07:13,617
I wanna make sure the couches
we get are really comfortable.

107
00:07:13,618 --> 00:07:17,704
- Just in case we have some late nights.
- Mr. Rabitowitz.

108
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:20,206
This is a place of business.

109
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:23,251
Ugh, can we just freeze in this moment
for a second?

110
00:07:23,252 --> 00:07:26,671
I just wanna remember this instant
where for once in my life,

111
00:07:26,672 --> 00:07:28,715
- everything was going...
- Hold that thought.

112
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:29,758
What is it?

113
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,927
Ugh. My wife and I are going
to the ballet tonight,

114
00:07:31,928 --> 00:07:33,821
there's a real ish
with the restaurant.

115
00:07:33,846 --> 00:07:36,932
- This is the wife you're divorcing, right?
- You know how it is.

116
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:40,184
You say you want a divorce
and she says, "No, we can make this work."

117
00:07:40,185 --> 00:07:43,104
You go to counseling and
remember why you fell in love with her

118
00:07:43,105 --> 00:07:45,523
in the first place
and then, blah, blah, it's a whole thing.

119
00:07:45,524 --> 00:07:47,734
We've been sleeping together
for three months.

120
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:51,488
- We're about to start a company together.
- None of that has to change.

121
00:07:51,489 --> 00:07:55,366
I am definitely going to divorce
her probably, it's just...

122
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:58,202
Ugh. It's hard to explain to someone
who's never been married.

123
00:07:58,203 --> 00:07:59,579
- Listen, this is...
- Oh!

124
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,665
Sorry, Katie just said something funny.

125
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,810
- What?
- I gotta hop. I love you, though.

126
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:14,361
Ha, ha. Okay, keep the engine running,
I'll be back in a... Oh.

127
00:08:14,846 --> 00:08:16,989
- Hey.
- Hey.

128
00:08:17,015 --> 00:08:20,851
Um, I'm just here to pick up some stuff.
I'm going away for a while.

129
00:08:20,852 --> 00:08:23,269
- Oh, where?
- The Giggleship.

130
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,897
It's the comedy cruise line
People magazine

131
00:08:25,898 --> 00:08:30,109
- once called "a comedy cruise line."
- Comedy cruise line?

132
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,405
Oh right, your improv thing.
How was your, uh, graduation show?

133
00:08:34,406 --> 00:08:38,076
- It was two months ago. You missed it.
- Sorry.

134
00:08:38,077 --> 00:08:39,452
- No, you're not.
- Well...

135
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:44,123
Hey, do you remember the morning
after my first night here?

136
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:47,377
I don't know why everyone keeps asking
if I remember things. I don't.

137
00:08:47,378 --> 00:08:50,463
Just as a general rule,
if your question begins, "Do you remember"

138
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:53,967
and doesn't end with "how much you hated
Moulin Rouge," the answer's no.

139
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:57,863
I was so happy to have a place
to stay that I made pancakes.

140
00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:00,223
And you kept eating them
so I kept making them.

141
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:03,852
And then you got mad at me
for letting you eat so many pancakes.

142
00:09:03,853 --> 00:09:06,938
You tried to chase me around the pool,
but you were too hungover

143
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:11,860
and also full from the pancakes
so instead... you took a nap.

144
00:09:11,861 --> 00:09:16,907
And when you woke up, you said,
"Thanks for the pancakes.

145
00:09:16,908 --> 00:09:20,493
- Now get out of my house."
- I don't remember any of that.

146
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:25,040
Well, anyway, I'm finally moving out,
just like you wanted.

147
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:28,585
Good. Honestly, you'll probably
be better off without me.

148
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:33,590
Yeah. But we had some good times,
though, right?

149
00:09:33,591 --> 00:09:38,636
- Did we?
- Right. Well, um, take care.

150
00:09:38,637 --> 00:09:42,366
Hey, I hope you can find a way
to be happy, BoJack.

151
00:09:42,391 --> 00:09:45,911
- I really do.
- Yeah, okay.

152
00:09:46,812 --> 00:09:47,913
Hey, Todd?

153
00:09:50,858 --> 00:09:53,335
You need to get your shit together.

154
00:09:53,819 --> 00:09:57,321
- Ugh.
- Rutabaga and I are starting a new agency.

155
00:09:57,322 --> 00:10:00,825
I want you to come onboard
and write celebrity tweets.

156
00:10:00,826 --> 00:10:03,327
- I don't know how to do that.
- You're a ghost-writer.

157
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:06,497
It's the same as writing a book,
they're just a lot shorter

158
00:10:06,498 --> 00:10:07,999
and more people read them.

159
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,086
All right, but why are you helping me?

160
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:14,631
Because my life is a mess right now and I
compulsively take care of other people

161
00:10:14,632 --> 00:10:16,507
when I don't know how
to take care of myself.

162
00:10:16,508 --> 00:10:19,803
Oh. I was hoping it was
because you believed in me.

163
00:10:19,804 --> 00:10:20,905
I don't.

164
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:26,559
Welcome to my Giggleship.

165
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,271
For us, it's a place to realize
our higher selves. For the paying public,

166
00:10:30,272 --> 00:10:34,358
it's a place to watch improv and drink
watered-down margaritas for 8.99.

167
00:10:34,359 --> 00:10:37,403
Wow, we must all make a lot of money.

168
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:41,908
No, no, you just get paid
in experience and stage time.

169
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:45,662
- Which in a way is even better than money.
- Say what?

170
00:10:45,663 --> 00:10:47,998
Look, We've arrived
at your living quarters.

171
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:54,420
Wow. No more couch-sleeping for this guy.
He gets a mattress.

172
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:55,505
That's the spirit.

173
00:10:55,506 --> 00:10:58,925
And you can use improv to make
this room anything you want it to be.

174
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:02,738
My cabin is exactly like yours,
but when I use my imagination,

175
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:06,349
it becomes a rich stateroom
with a treasure chest full of booty.

176
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,228
I like a big booty, if you know what
I mean. And I don't mean a butt.

177
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:16,501
You really are the master
of spontaneous witticisms.

178
00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:24,201
All right, you ready? This is go time.
There's no turning back now.

179
00:11:24,202 --> 00:11:25,994
- Oh, I am ready.
- Great.

180
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:29,831
Now let's get out there and tell all those
garbage rat bastard sons of bastards

181
00:11:29,832 --> 00:11:32,416
what we really think of them,
once and for all.

182
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:34,961
Everyone. We have an announcement.

183
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:37,005
Guys, we have an announcement.

184
00:11:37,006 --> 00:11:40,299
- What's going on?
- Mr. Witherspoon's in the hospital.

185
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,886
- He had a stroke.
- Oh.

186
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:45,864
Well, you know what you rat bastards
can stroke?

187
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,183
- Uh... Oh.
- My big, hairy...

188
00:11:49,393 --> 00:11:52,121
Well, we burned that bridge.

189
00:11:57,193 --> 00:12:01,988
Todd, you should be up a magician's
sleeve because you are a card.

190
00:12:03,532 --> 00:12:06,076
Hey, Bryan. What's going on here?

191
00:12:06,077 --> 00:12:09,246
- He refused to scrub the floors.
- Oh, Bryan.

192
00:12:09,247 --> 00:12:12,082
Please. My knees were cramping
so I needed to stand.

193
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:16,253
But I'm real good at cleaning windows.
Look.

194
00:12:16,254 --> 00:12:20,257
That's solid space-work.
Bryan, don't worry.

195
00:12:20,258 --> 00:12:22,693
I'm gonna go to Copernicus
and get this sorted out.

196
00:12:23,594 --> 00:12:27,489
Copernicus? Uh, Copernicus?

197
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:29,158
Huh?

198
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:32,077
Huh.

199
00:12:34,563 --> 00:12:35,914
Whoa.

200
00:12:38,734 --> 00:12:42,570
One Hundred and One Butt Jokes?

201
00:12:42,571 --> 00:12:47,200
"No parking in the rear?"
Aah!

202
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:51,454
- Copernicus is a fraud!
- A fraud? Me? Ow.

203
00:12:51,455 --> 00:12:54,099
- Aah.
- I had such high hopes for you, Todd.

204
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,709
Normally, I'd make a perfectly
timed butt joke here,

205
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,629
but as you can see,
I don't have my book.

206
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,215
- Oh!
- Guards, take this subversive

207
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:03,967
to the Yes And room.

208
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:06,844
- No.
- Hey, what are you doing?

209
00:13:06,845 --> 00:13:11,616
No. Shame on all of you! Just wait
till you see my Trip Advisor review.

210
00:13:11,642 --> 00:13:14,060
This cruise is getting three stars.

211
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:17,873
Because I have very
mixed feelings about it.

212
00:13:21,152 --> 00:13:24,362
- Carolyn, we are free.
- Yeah.

213
00:13:24,363 --> 00:13:26,530
Real quick, kiss me once.
Then kiss me twice.

214
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:28,574
I don't want to do that anymore.

215
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:31,911
- I told you, we can make this work...
- No. I don't want...

216
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:34,473
Carolyn, you're a single woman
in your 40s.

217
00:13:34,498 --> 00:13:36,833
- Can you really afford to be picky?
- What?

218
00:13:36,834 --> 00:13:40,586
I'm just saying, what, you think you're
gonna find some perfect unattached guy

219
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:42,380
who's gonna love you like I do?

220
00:13:42,381 --> 00:13:45,091
Who's gonna make you laugh
and feel good about yourself?

221
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:47,135
This is it, Carolyn, this is what you get.

222
00:13:47,136 --> 00:13:49,220
If you're holding out
for something better,

223
00:13:49,221 --> 00:13:52,824
well, I hate to break it to you, but
you're gonna be alone for a long time.

224
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,412
I'm not afraid of being alone.

225
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:59,356
And you might wanna find
someplace else to work

226
00:13:59,357 --> 00:14:02,859
- because you're not coming with me.
- Wait, wait, wait, what?

227
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,403
It's my company.
My name is on all the paperwork.

228
00:14:05,404 --> 00:14:08,031
I think I can do it without you.
Good luck.

229
00:14:08,032 --> 00:14:14,346
- Whoa, Carolyn, we just... Come... Carolyn.
- My name is Princess Carolyn.

230
00:14:16,415 --> 00:14:18,875
And as I held that baby in my arms,

231
00:14:18,876 --> 00:14:21,336
I knew I had been given a second chance.

232
00:14:21,337 --> 00:14:26,924
A chance to finally make things right.
And this time, I was gonna win...

233
00:14:26,925 --> 00:14:28,801
the race of life.

234
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:37,810
- Whoa. That was actually good.
- We're doing a full awards push.

235
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:40,146
You should clear your schedule
for the next year.

236
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:42,523
Buckle up, buddy,
this is the year of Secretariat.

237
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:46,569
But it wasn't Secretariat.
And it wasn't me. It was a computer.

238
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,488
What difference does it make?
Smile and collect your trophies.

239
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:50,907
- You know Ana Spanikopita?
- Hello.

240
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:53,743
- Aah!
- They call her the Oscar whisperer.

241
00:14:53,744 --> 00:14:56,537
- Ana Spanikopita. Big fan.
- Thank you, it's...

242
00:14:56,538 --> 00:14:59,040
I meant you are going to be
a big fan of me

243
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,459
because I am going
to win you an Oscar.

244
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,710
Ana is the best there is.

245
00:15:02,711 --> 00:15:05,963
- You better start writing your speech.
- I don't have to thank my parents, do I?

246
00:15:05,964 --> 00:15:08,841
You're funny.
I am literally laughing out loud.

247
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:10,551
- Uh...
- We gotta get you on a talk show.

248
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:13,512
You have any weird history
with Kelly Ripa I should know about?

249
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:17,034
- No. Well, define "weird."
- You look doughy. Do you run?

250
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:19,727
- Cardio? Anything?
- I mean, occasionally.

251
00:15:19,728 --> 00:15:23,273
Excuse me?
That was such a beautiful performance.

252
00:15:23,274 --> 00:15:25,442
- So brave.
- Thank you.

253
00:15:25,443 --> 00:15:27,735
Everyone here loves you.
Do you feel that?

254
00:15:27,736 --> 00:15:29,612
- Feel that energy!
- They don't love me.

255
00:15:29,613 --> 00:15:32,031
- They don't know me.
- That's why they love you.

256
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:35,868
He's right. Our research shows
America likes to think they know you,

257
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:38,955
and then they like learning more
about you, but at a certain point

258
00:15:38,956 --> 00:15:43,418
they pass a threshold where they actually
know you and then they find you weird

259
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:44,627
and off-putting.

260
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:47,755
Are you saying that nobody who really
knows me could ever love me?

261
00:15:47,756 --> 00:15:50,401
- No, no, no. Not nobody. No.
- No.

262
00:15:51,302 --> 00:15:53,552
What am I doing here?

263
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:56,407
I don't know where you're going,
but if you could run there.

264
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:12,863
Sextina, hi. Thanks for meeting me here.
I'm really excited to be working with you.

265
00:16:12,864 --> 00:16:16,659
Listen, chitch, if you're going
to tweet for Sextina Aquafina,

266
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,471
you need to capture the essence
of my personal brand, okay?

267
00:16:19,497 --> 00:16:23,458
All upper caps, no punctuation, lots
of cryptic bullshit about the Illuminati

268
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:26,043
and make sure to mention
my preferred brands, okay?

269
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:32,258
Beats by Dre, Abercrombie and Fitch
and  brand fin polish.

270
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:35,928
- Can you spell that last one?
- No.

271
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:38,282
I gotta go get my blowhole bleached.

272
00:16:39,057 --> 00:16:44,079
Hey, thank you so much.
You people are the real stars. Huh?

273
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:51,402
Hi. I'm Sarah Koenig.

274
00:16:51,403 --> 00:16:54,989
This is one ringtone told over
the course of several rings.

275
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,826
And the story it's telling you
is to answer your phone.

276
00:16:58,827 --> 00:17:01,662
- Hello?
- Hey, Diane.

277
00:17:01,663 --> 00:17:03,223
Hey. Uh...

278
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:09,086
So... How's Cordovia?

279
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:11,464
It's... hard.

280
00:17:11,465 --> 00:17:17,595
- Do you know where the batteries are?
- What?

281
00:17:17,596 --> 00:17:21,992
- The batteries in the remote died.
- Did you check the junk drawer?

282
00:17:22,017 --> 00:17:24,060
Yeah, I looked in the junk drawer.

283
00:17:24,061 --> 00:17:26,270
I'm gonna take them
out of the smoke detector.

284
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:29,440
- No, don't do that.
- Well, I'm out of options.

285
00:17:29,441 --> 00:17:34,945
Listen, I know this sounds crazy, but I
think maybe you should get back here

286
00:17:34,946 --> 00:17:38,824
- so you can help me find the batteries.
- Yeah?

287
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:42,161
I know you're doing important work
and it's a long way to travel,

288
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:45,956
but I need you here
and I think you should come home.

289
00:17:45,957 --> 00:17:50,794
- Is that really what you want?
- Of course it is.

290
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:56,842
Well, okay, I'm looking
at this website right now

291
00:17:56,843 --> 00:18:01,573
and it says if I leave immediately,
I can still make it home tonight.

292
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,226
- That sounds great.
- I love you.

293
00:18:05,227 --> 00:18:09,397
I love you, too, Diane.
You know, it's the funniest thing.

294
00:18:09,398 --> 00:18:12,316
There is a woman in this restaurant
who looks just like you.

295
00:18:12,317 --> 00:18:16,171
I guess I just have one of those faces.

296
00:18:18,782 --> 00:18:23,077
Okay, party people,
we have time for one more suggestion.

297
00:18:23,078 --> 00:18:25,329
- Todd.
- Did someone say movie theater?

298
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,872
I heard movie theater.

299
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:30,793
I'm Abe Lincoln and I'm gonna wear
my giant hat to the movies.

300
00:18:30,794 --> 00:18:34,797
Who's this sitting behind me?
John Wilkes Booth. Uh-oh.

301
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:38,635
- Todd, it's me, BoJack.
- BoJack?

302
00:18:38,636 --> 00:18:41,720
- Todd, I'm getting you out of here.
- I can't leave.

303
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,156
I need to take suggestions.

304
00:18:43,181 --> 00:18:46,684
Okay, well, here's a suggestion,
your name is Todd.

305
00:18:46,685 --> 00:18:53,650
You're 24, you live on my couch and
you've always seen the good in me somehow.

306
00:18:53,651 --> 00:18:55,443
You've been brainwashed into thinking

307
00:18:55,444 --> 00:18:58,237
that you belong here, but you don't.
You belong back home.

308
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:01,157
If you're any kind of improviser,
you'll take that suggestion

309
00:19:01,158 --> 00:19:02,533
and you'll run with it.

310
00:19:02,534 --> 00:19:03,719
Huh.

311
00:19:04,953 --> 00:19:06,870
Let's get out of here.

312
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:10,416
I'm afraid that getting out of here
is not an option.

313
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:13,836
- You've seen too much.
- What the hell are you gonna do about it?

314
00:19:13,837 --> 00:19:17,256
- Stop you. With these.
- Oh, no.

315
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:19,883
- Don't do anything crazy, guys.
- You can't be serious.

316
00:19:19,884 --> 00:19:22,303
- Just get behind me, BoJack.
- No sudden moves.

317
00:19:22,304 --> 00:19:25,156
Be reasonable.
You wouldn't wanna puncture the hull.

318
00:19:25,182 --> 00:19:28,601
Especially not when I have this
smoke bomb. Ka-pow!

319
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:30,978
- I've lost them. Where did they go?
- Seriously?

320
00:19:30,979 --> 00:19:34,874
Now feel the wrath of my flamethrower.

321
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:38,027
Too bad we're wearing sunscreen

322
00:19:38,028 --> 00:19:41,947
with SPF a million which protects
against flamethrowers.

323
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:43,449
Oh, no.

324
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,369
Now we finish this
with our strangle machine.

325
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,704
Beep, boop, boop. Machine?

326
00:19:47,705 --> 00:19:52,082
- Strangle those guys.
- Ugh!  BoJack, help.

327
00:19:53,711 --> 00:19:55,836
There is literally nothing
happening to you.

328
00:19:55,837 --> 00:20:01,050
You don't understand, if you die
in improv, you die in real life.

329
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:04,721
So stupid. Fine.
I guess I have a guard killing machine?

330
00:20:04,722 --> 00:20:06,406
Beep, boop, beep.

331
00:20:06,431 --> 00:20:09,392
No. I have a wife and children.

332
00:20:09,393 --> 00:20:12,019
Well, they're improvised,
but they're real to me.

333
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:19,210
- Can this be the end?
- This whole ship is full of idiots.

334
00:20:19,695 --> 00:20:21,045
Beep, boop.

335
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:28,160
Come on, come on, come on.

336
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:30,538
Come on, come on, Todd.
Almost there.

337
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:32,540
Wait. Where are you going?

338
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,418
Sorry, improv is fun
and great and everything,

339
00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:40,256
but you guys are really into improv.
I'm gonna go with my friend.

340
00:20:40,257 --> 00:20:42,966
Your friend?
I didn't realize this man was your friend.

341
00:20:42,967 --> 00:20:46,053
Well, then, by all means,
go with him, Todd.

342
00:20:46,054 --> 00:20:49,908
But, see, I thought this was the man
who sabotaged your rock opera.

343
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:55,104
The one who constantly abuses you and
makes you shower with a hose in the yard.

344
00:20:55,105 --> 00:20:56,689
I invited him to.

345
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,443
The one who's never said a kind word
to you the entire time you've known him.

346
00:21:00,444 --> 00:21:05,615
- Is this your friend, Todd?
- It's more complicated than that.

347
00:21:05,616 --> 00:21:10,035
- Is it? We're your friends, Todd.
- More than that, we're a family.

348
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:13,891
- I, uh...
- Hash browns.

349
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:16,208
- What?
- I heard hash browns.

350
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:19,712
- Martha, did you see my hash browns?
- Oh, my God, do you ever turn it off?

351
00:21:19,713 --> 00:21:24,383
It was hash browns, not pancakes.
The first morning you stayed with me.

352
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:27,970
You kept making them and I kept eating
them and then I threw up in the pool.

353
00:21:27,971 --> 00:21:32,033
That made you throw up in the pool. Then I
got mad at you for throwing up in my pool.

354
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:35,436
- But, you said, "I'll clean it up."
- And did I clean it up?

355
00:21:35,437 --> 00:21:38,021
No. You didn't.
I had to call the pool cleaner.

356
00:21:38,022 --> 00:21:39,816
- Ha, ha.
- And you said,

357
00:21:39,817 --> 00:21:41,358
"Thank you for letting me stay here.

358
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:45,070
I don't have anywhere else to go."
And I remember when you said that,

359
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:49,116
"I don't have anywhere else to go,"
because I felt good about myself.

360
00:21:49,117 --> 00:21:51,661
And I don't feel that way a lot.

361
00:21:51,662 --> 00:21:55,205
Letting you stay with me
was the best thing I ever did on purpose.

362
00:21:55,206 --> 00:21:58,000
I don't think I ever told you that.
But I should have.

363
00:21:58,001 --> 00:22:00,854
Because you're my best friend, Todd.

364
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,842
I'm not gonna lie, if you just made all
that up, that was some really good improv.

365
00:22:05,843 --> 00:22:08,027
Game recognize game.

366
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,367
- Why do you have a boat?
- Uh, I don't remember.

367
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:20,981
- Hello? Prince?
- Listen, bozo, I keep getting calls

368
00:22:20,982 --> 00:22:23,942
from this New York playwright,
she really wants to talk to you.

369
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:26,987
- She says you know her, Jill Pill?
- Jill Pill?

370
00:22:26,988 --> 00:22:29,948
Ring any bells?
Apparently, she worked on your TV show.

371
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:32,951
- Horsin' Around?
- No, actually. The other TV show.

372
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:36,205
Other TV show? Oh, shit. Jill.

373
00:22:36,206 --> 00:22:39,333
I'm moving into the new office
and I got Herb's ashes here.

374
00:22:39,334 --> 00:22:41,711
I really don't know what
to do with this thing.

375
00:22:41,712 --> 00:22:43,671
- Do you want it?
- Yeah.

376
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:47,400
Why did I take you with me?

377
00:22:50,303 --> 00:22:51,929
Herb loved orphans.

378
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,825
Mostly as a delivery apparatus
for hackneyed punchlines

379
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,642
and mawkish sentimentality, but still.

380
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:59,603
And we will do our part
to honor his legacy.

381
00:22:59,604 --> 00:23:01,564
- Hey, who's Jerb?
- What?

382
00:23:01,565 --> 00:23:04,316
Jerb Ka... Why does it say "Jerb Kazzaz?"

383
00:23:04,317 --> 00:23:07,820
Your e-mail said "Jerb."
I forwarded it to the plaque guy.

384
00:23:07,821 --> 00:23:10,489
- Is it not...?
- No, obviously that was a typo.

385
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:14,201
Why would I want to dedicate the orphanage
to the memory of Jerb Kazzaz?

386
00:23:14,202 --> 00:23:17,496
Kind of sounds like something you'd get
at a Mediterranean restaurant,

387
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:18,622
but wouldn't finish.

388
00:23:18,623 --> 00:23:22,209
And the waiter would say, "You want me
to box up this jerb kazzaz for you?"

389
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,962
- And you'd say, "No."
- You gotta fix this.

390
00:23:24,963 --> 00:23:28,382
Really? We spent a lot of money
on this plaque, you know?

391
00:23:28,383 --> 00:23:30,843
- And on the t-shirts.
- Jerb's kids?

392
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:33,262
No, there's no Jerb. It's Herb.

393
00:23:33,263 --> 00:23:36,658
T-shirt's say Jerb
so I'm going by the t-shirts.

394
00:23:38,226 --> 00:23:42,354
You know, Herb would probably think
that this is pretty funny

395
00:23:42,355 --> 00:23:46,609
- that you couldn't even get this right.
- Yeah. He would.

396
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,738
- So, in a way...
- Yeah.

397
00:23:50,739 --> 00:23:52,531
You wanna get some
Mediterranean food?

398
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:55,593
You read my mind.

399
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:01,474
Oh, God. Lungs on fire.

400
00:24:06,838 --> 00:24:11,258
Ow. Crap. I hate this.
Running is terrible.

401
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:13,051
Everything is the worst.

402
00:24:18,516 --> 00:24:20,577
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

403
00:24:22,938 --> 00:24:25,105
- It gets easier.
- Huh?

404
00:24:25,106 --> 00:24:27,542
Every day, it gets a little easier.

405
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:30,736
- Yeah?
- But you gotta do it every day.

406
00:24:30,737 --> 00:24:34,799
That's the hard part.
But it does get easier.

407
00:24:38,286 --> 00:24:39,846
Okay.

408
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:28,061
Boxer versus raptor.
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.
