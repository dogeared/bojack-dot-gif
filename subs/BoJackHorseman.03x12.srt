1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:08,509
Sarah Lynn! Sarah Lynn!

2
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:10,636
Okay, one more song.

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,304
I'm gonna slow things down.

4
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:16,790
This is "My Heinie Ain't So Tiny."

5
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:26,276
Sarah Lynn is very tired.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,446
Can you just tell her BoJack's
here? Horseman. I'm an old friend.

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,782
Well, I'll tell her, but...

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,079
BoJack?
Oh, my God! Bring him in!

9
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:40,207
- I can't believe you came to my concert.
- It was incredible.

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,085
When you sang that one ballad and
shot fireworks out of your boobs,

11
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,671
that was such a moving
tribute to gays in the military.

12
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,130
We are going out.

13
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,466
Before you go, I need
you to sign these posters.

14
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,052
It's for charity. Doctors
Without Posters.

15
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,054
Okay. BoJack, can you
hang out for a minute?

16
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,932
- Yeah. I'm not going anywhere.
- Also, we have those radio records,

17
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,135
and you're doing the print
ads for Sarah Lynn's Stank,

18
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,561
the new fragrance from Kevin Kline.

19
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,938
- You mean Calvin Klein.
- Kevin Kline, BoJack.

20
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,732
He's the only man who
truly understands my fragrance.

21
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,485
I'll come back in 20 for those posters.

22
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,613
Oh, my God. Being famous is the worst.

23
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:15,367
- Ugh! Yeah, you're telling me.
- No, but, like, really famous.

24
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,786
- Uh...
- How can I explain it to someone like you?

25
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,913
I feel like all my friends only like

26
00:01:19,938 --> 00:01:21,981
me because I'm Sarah
Lynn, you know.

27
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,668
- Nobody cares about Sarah Lipschitz.
- Who's Sarah Lipschitz?

28
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,831
The lawyer who helped me

29
00:01:25,856 --> 00:01:27,611
change my name from
Sarah Helmulfarb.

30
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:28,505
Oof!

31
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:32,259
It is so great to see a real friend
who knew me before I got huge

32
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,177
and isn't just trying to
get something out of me.

33
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,095
Right.

34
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,180
I swear you are, like, the
only one I have left.

35
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,684
I am this close to falling
off the deep end.

36
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,479
I know I'm smiling right now, but
the light inside me is dying.

37
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,397
Uh, what?

38
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,086
But here I am blah-blah-blah-ing about

39
00:01:47,111 --> 00:01:48,633
my own boring, sexy,
thrilling life.

40
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,485
What is going on with you?

41
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:54,197
Well, actually, I'm doing this new show,
The BoJack Horseman Show.

42
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,121
- I don't know if you've seen it or...
- Ugh, I'm so busy with the tour.

43
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,870
Yeah, no, of course, no, but
it's been a lot of fun.

44
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,415
The ratings aren't great, but
we have this upcoming episode,

45
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,960
and we're looking for
a really big guest star.

46
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:10,088
Oh. You want me to be on your show?

47
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:15,552
Well, I just thought it would be
really fun for... the both of us.

48
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,138
You know, like the old days.

49
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:22,267
I have the script with me if
you want to take a look at it.

50
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:25,228
Um, okay. Why don't you put
it on that pile over there?

51
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,564
And I'll get to it when
I have some free time.

52
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,066
- Over here?
- Yeah.

53
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,818
I'd love to keep hanging out, but
these doctors need their posters,

54
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,403
and I'm already pretty exhausted.

55
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,529
You should probably go.

56
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:37,324
- Oh, okay.
- It's all very exhausting.

57
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,617
Thanks again for coming.

58
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,079
Like I said, it's always
nice to see a... you.

59
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,580
Yeah.

60
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,708
<i>Adam Levine
has tweeted his sympathies.</i>

61
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:50,212
<i>"Today we lost an icon. #SheWillBeLoved</i>

62
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,839

63
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,008
Again, for those just joining us,

64
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:59,596
actress and pop star
Sarah Lynn is dead at 31.

65
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,263

66
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:02,534
Day 75 at sea, there's a
darkness brewing on the horizon.

67
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,912
I feel it. What say you, skippy?

68
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:10,417
<i>I think you got a
touch of the ocean madness, Margo.</i>

69
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,253
And I think you got a real smart mouth.

70
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,255
You want another night in the box?

71
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,673
<i>No, anything but that!</i>

72
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:20,844
Then quit your yappin'
and fix Mama a Sazerac.

73
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,391
Hey, is that character
actress Margo Martindale?

74
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,852
She's on the FBI's Most Wanted list

75
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,352
and the AV Club's list of 20

76
00:04:30,377 --> 00:04:32,755
actresses that always
make everything better.

77
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,150
- We gotta call this in, right?
- That depends.

78
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,695
Are we professional blimp
pilots, or are we casting directors?

79
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,113
Blimp pilots, sir.

80
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:43,825
Then we're not being paid to
discover underutilized character actresses.

81
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,952
We're being paid to pilot this blimp.

82
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,622
<i>Hey, Margo, do you see something
out there across the water?</i>

83
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,917
Yeah. What is that?

84
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,967
All clear
from here to Los Angeles.

85
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,552
We've hit a few delays,

86
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,180
but you'll get your
precious cargo by tomorrow.

87
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,097
Tomorrow?

88
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,558
But the big opening of
my restaurant is tonight!

89
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,275
How can I offer the real Italian

90
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,545
cuisine without my real
Italian spaghett'?

91
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,898
Spaghett' is how Italian
people say "spaghetti."

92
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,983
We'll get you your pasta.

93
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,444
Better do what he says. He
might have friends in the Mob.

94
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:22,948
"Friends in the Mob"? That
is an ugly stereotype.

95
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:28,203
You heard the man. Set this
boat's controls to "faster."

96
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,287
Aye-aye, Cap'n.

97
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:36,086
Oh, I see how it is. Wanna
play a game of chicken, huh?

98
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,339
<i>I don't think this
is a good idea, Margo.</i>

99
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,467
Cram it, skip! Those limp
dicks are about to find out

100
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,345
what savvy film and television
viewers have known for years.

101
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:50,642
Character actress Margo
Martindale ain't afraid of nothin'!

102
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,937
The boats are about to
collide! We have to do something!

103
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,981
You know damn well, when
we took to the sky,

104
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,317
we made a solemn oath never to
meddle in the affairs of land nor sea.

105
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,111
We are sworn but to observe.

106
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,696
This is the blimper's promise.

107
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,116
Oh, no! The boats are
tearing each other apart!

108
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,452
Crates and crates of spaghetti
are pouring out into the ocean!

109
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,539
I'm watching the same boat collision
you are. You don't need to narrate it.

110
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,583
Oh!

111
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:19,713
No! Skippy! He was too
pure for this world!

112
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,133
Oh, no!

113
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,760
The pasta is cooking!

114
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:29,848
If only we had some olive
oil to reduce the stickiness.

115
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:33,852
But olive oil doesn't actually
reduce the stickiness in pasta.

116
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,687
That's only a myth.

117
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,733
No! I've wasted so much of my life

118
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:43,695
stirring olive oil into pasta!

119
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:48,158
Disaster al dente off
the coast of San Clemente!

120
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,827
Twelve tons of pasta have
leaked into the ocean,

121
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,081
and the massive carbo load is heading
straight to Pacific Ocean City.

122
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,252
Joining us via Google Hangout

123
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,630
is spaghetti scientist Carla Hall.

124
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,883
- What can you tell us, Carla?
- Well, Tom, as the spaghetti cooks,

125
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,093
it will expand, smothering the town

126
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,971
and tenderly broiling the
sea life who reside there.

127
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,514
Is there any way to prevent

128
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,684
this delicious-sounding
environmental catastrophe?

129
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,186
The only hope for rescue would be

130
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,105
if someone had an enormous
quantity of spaghetti strainers

131
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,523
just sitting around the house,

132
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,902
but that person would also
need access to a fleet of drivers

133
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,904
to transport said spaghetti strainers,

134
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,239
and in order to strain the
spaghetti fast enough,

135
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:31,076
the drivers would also need to
be incredibly strong swimmers,

136
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,954
like, just as an
example, hot, sexy killer whales.

137
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,623
Is there such a
savior who could possibly fit

138
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,668
that ridiculously
specific set of criteria?

139
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,867
I don't know, Tom, but as they used to

140
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:44,279
say on my favorite TV
show, let's find out.

141
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:50,512
A movie, during the day? Dare I?

142
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,722
One for Secretariat, please!

143
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:54,724
Thank you.

144
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,601
And, now, to turn my phone off.

145
00:07:56,685 --> 00:08:00,772
If anyone needs me in the next two
hours, they'll just have to wait.

146
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,817
<i>This tragedy truly
puts the "no" into noodle,</i>

147
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,697
the "ruh-roh" in rotelli, and
the "oh, man" in manicotti.

148
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,865
Damn it, Randy. Just pick your best one.

149
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,909
- What's going on?
- You didn't hear?

150
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,577
They need spaghetti strainers stat,

151
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,789
or it's "pasta la
vista" for Pacific Ocean City.

152
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,791
Oh, no!

153
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,546
Come on, come on, come
on! Pick up, Mr. Peanutbutter!

154
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,715
- Hello?
- Oh! Mr. Peanutbutter, we need...

155
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,508
You've reached the
voicemail of Mr. Peanutbutter.

156
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,843
No!

157
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:34,097
<i>I'm not just running
for me. I'm running for America.</i>

158
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,558
Oh-ho-ho!

159
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,561
Cabracadabblers, to Mr.
Peanutbutter's house!

160
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:43,857
Mr. Peanutbutter's House the show, or
Mr. Peanutbutter's house the house?

161
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,234
The house. Obviously, the house.

162
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,573
Wow, that was a good movie.

163
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,492
Was it Oscar-worthy? Who's to say?

164
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,328
Ninety-eight messages? Better
listen to them all, in order.

165
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,831
<i>Mr. Peanutbutter, call me
back as soon as you get this, okay?</i>

166
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,754
<i>We need your strainers.
This is life and death.</i>

167
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,877
- Oh, my God!
-  <i>Mr. Peanutbutter,</i>

168
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,214
<i>I'm at your house with the entire
Cabracadabra fleet, but we can't get in!</i>

169
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,591
<i>You need to get over here!</i>

170
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,302
<i>It's a spaghetti-strainer-
related emergency.</i>

171
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,555
All right, buddy, just as soon as
I listen to these other 96 messages.

172
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,891
<i>Good afternoon, I'm
calling from Center Theater Group.</i>

173
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,726
<i>You saw a play once eight years ago.</i>

174
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,187
<i>I wonder if I could interest
you in a full season subscription...</i>

175
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,980
Oh, I don't have time for this!

176
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,025
If we don't get some kind of miracle...

177
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,110
Wait! In the distance! Is that...?

178
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,029
No, it can't be!

179
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,951
Spaghetti or not, here I come.

180
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:42,707
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

181
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,960
Sabrina, I'm coming down
for my birthday surprise!

182
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,378
Oh, no!

183
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,924
Well, I've heard of pasta
point of no return,

184
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,051
<i>but this is ridiculous!</i>

185
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,598
<i>Why didn't you just tell me
you made too much spaghetti?</i>

186
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:03,228
I thought if you knew I made a big
mess that you wouldn't love me anymore.

187
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,563
- Aw!
- Sabrina, that's not going to happen.

188
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,690
We're a family now, no matter what,

189
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,026
and I will always be there for you.

190
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:10,944
Okay.

191
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,948
Now, get in that kitchen and
eat all that spaghetti.

192
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,785
I gotta eat all
that? That's too much, man!

193
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,623
I never understood why
the Horsin' Around house

194
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,333
- had two sets of stairs.
- What?

195
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,169
One in the living room and
one in the kitchen. Why?

196
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,046
Have you ever been in a house like that?

197
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,715
- What are you doing here?
- You didn't answer your phone.

198
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,800
I was worried about you.

199
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,305
The funeral was huge. There
were so many people there.

200
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,850
I kept thinking, "I did this to her,"

201
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,518
and everyone was just standing around

202
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:45,210
like, "Well, this was bound to happen,"

203
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,772
but... it wasn't bound to happen.

204
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,941
I'm really sorry, BoJack.

205
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,317
I don't know how to be, Diane.

206
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,653
It doesn't get better and
it doesn't get easier.

207
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,781
I can't keep lying to myself, saying
"I'm gonna change." I'm poison.

208
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,616
- BoJack...
- I come from poison.

209
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,786
I have poison inside me, and
I destroy everything I touch.

210
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,163
That's my legacy.

211
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,290
I have nothing to show for
the life that I've lived,

212
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,733
and I have nobody in my life who's

213
00:11:06,756 --> 00:11:07,997
better off for having known me.

214
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,336
- That isn't true.
- Isn't it, though?

215
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,758
When I was a kid, I
used to watch you on TV.

216
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,261
And you know I didn't
have the best family.

217
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,138
Things weren't that great for me.

218
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,766
But, for half an hour every
week, I got to watch this show

219
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,603
about four people who had nobody,

220
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,772
who came together and became a family.

221
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:33,735
And, for half an hour
every week, I had a home,

222
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,862
and it helped me survive.

223
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,707
BoJack, there are
millions of people who

224
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:41,224
are better off for
having known you.

225
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,536
Why did you never tell me that?

226
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,415
I guess to preserve some
fiction of journalistic objectivity.

227
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,918
- Like that's a thing.
- I know you don't want to hear this,

228
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,399
but you're too good to be writing

229
00:11:51,424 --> 00:11:52,903
Instagram captions
for celebrities.

230
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,714
- I'm not just...
- I'm sorry, but you are.

231
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,133
- You know you are.
- Okay. Thank you.

232
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,803
And I wish you didn't get so
distant after you moved out.

233
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,973
- I'm sorry.
- You know me better than anybody,

234
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,392
and you can't not be a part of my life.

235
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,357
Tools! This is Brad.

236
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,776
- I want to do Ethan Around.
- Oh, very funny.

237
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,486
Is this Jeff from Hammers and More?

238
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,947
- No, it's me, BoJack Horseman.
- Wait, really?

239
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,492
Yeah. I think now more than ever people
need shows like Horsin' Around.

240
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,620
I... need a show like Horsin' Around.

241
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,665
Okay, but this isn't
like last time, is it?

242
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,333
Where you say you want to do it,

243
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,536
but then, I find out you
don't actually want to do it,

244
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,420
and then, your mean
publicist yells at me?

245
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,923
And, at the airport, on the way
home, I get one of those big pretzels,

246
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,591
but then, I drop the
pretzel on the ground,

247
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,551
and it gets eaten by a ant?

248
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,719
What? No.

249
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,429
You won't regret this, BoJack.

250
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,183
Attention, customers! Please
leave and never come back.

251
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,395
Tools! is closed forever.
I'm going Hollywoo!

252
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,566
Please, please! I'm no hero.

253
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,944
I'm just a guy with
some bowls full of holes.

254
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,404
Thanks again.

255
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,198
It's funny. You help
out at one disaster area,

256
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,573
and, suddenly, everybody loves

257
00:13:03,598 --> 00:13:04,933
you, unless you're Sean Penn.

258
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,786
Great PR for Cabracadabra, too.

259
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,204
Yeah, you can't buy that kind of

260
00:13:08,229 --> 00:13:10,105
press, and you can buy
most kinds of press.

261
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,500
I hope some of that press makes
its way to this reader

262
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,294
because she is not a
fan of Cabracadabra.

263
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:19,424
- She hates it.
- I don't hate Cabracadabra.

264
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,842
I just think it objectifies women

265
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,278
and contributes to a cheap and

266
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,286
damaging culture of
sexist commodification

267
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,015
that undercuts the exact reason it
was started in the first place.

268
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,725
But, you know, everything does that.

269
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:33,062
Cosmo does that. Kids' movies,
athletic gear... statues.

270
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,995
Yes, but this objectification of

271
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,215
women ended up saving
lots of lives,

272
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:41,696
many of whom were also
women, so, therefore, not sexist?

273
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,656
I can't argue with that.

274
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,783
Well, the good news is, you
don't have to anymore,

275
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,452
because I'm selling the company!

276
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,369
Oh!

277
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,421
You know, it's really too

278
00:13:49,446 --> 00:13:50,645
bad you shut down the agency,

279
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,957
because, if you could've held
out for just a couple more months,

280
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,084
right now, Vim would
be rolling in money.

281
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,128
I'm really happy for you,

282
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,464
but I'm actually enjoying my time off.

283
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,132
Ralph and I went on vacation.

284
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,176
Can you believe this
one had never been to Cairo?

285
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,720
Those Egyptians really
know how to treat a cat.

286
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,541
And what do you do, Ralph, that you

287
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:09,206
can just hop on a plane to Cairo?

288
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,768
Well, I own and operate my
own greeting card company,

289
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,686
but everywhere I go, I have a free room.

290
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,773
- Oh, because you're a mouse?
- What? No.

291
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,234
- Because I'm a Stilton.
- Oh, my God! Like Stilton hotels?

292
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,487
I gotta take this. It's my new agent.

293
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,113
- Hello?
- So, anyway...

294
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,240
Another
offer? That's incredible!

295
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,326
- Ralph and I...
- They want to pay me how much?

296
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,453
That is a lot of zeroes.
Sign me up.

297
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,622
What is he doing? You
never take the first offer.

298
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,832
Hey, Diane,
what have you been up to?

299
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,876
Well, I'm just weighing my options.

300
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,477
I don't want to just
jump into my next...

301
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,694
You know what you should do?

302
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,215
Ralph's sister Stefani is
starting a new website.

303
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:47,470
It's a feminism/lifestyle/celebrity
blog/ newsletter/community hub,

304
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:52,183
and she's looking for a partner/editor/
"bomb-ass super bitch," her words.

305
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,352
You'd be perfect for
it. I'll set a meeting.

306
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,105
Yeah, that could be cool. Why
don't you give her my info?

307
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:01,317
No, no. I'll just set a meeting. It's
easy. I'm not doing anything else.

308
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,653
- Except enjoying your time off, right?
- Right.

309
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,947
Wow, another amazing offer!

310
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,074
It's like everywhere I
look, money, money, money!

311
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,660
Even ten percent of this
would be quite a windfall.

312
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,958
- I like your friends.
- Yeah.

313
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,042
And I like this.

314
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,085
Mwah!

315
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,003
- This is working.
- I like it, too.

316
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,423
That was smart of you to
think of Diane for GirlCrush.

317
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,799
You're always making great connections.

318
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,384
That's probably why you
were such a good manager.

319
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,679
- I wasn't a manager. I was an agent.
- Oh, right. Sorry.

320
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,602
Well, whatever it was,
I'm glad that it's over,

321
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,521
because I don't want to
share you with anybody.

322
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,685
Oh, my God! Maybe that was the problem!

323
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,925
Maybe what was the problem?

324
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,920
All this time, I
thought I was an agent,

325
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,983
but what if what I was
really supposed to be was a manager?

326
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:42,957
What's the difference?

327
00:15:42,982 --> 00:15:44,885
It's a completely
different line of work.

328
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,779
An agent helps a client find jobs,

329
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,574
but a manager helps
manage a client's career.

330
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,137
- It sounds exactly the same.
- I think I'm having an epiphany.

331
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,370
It's like I've been wearing the
wrong bra size this whole time.

332
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,914
Okay, if this is the
thing that'll make you happy,

333
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,666
then I totally support you,

334
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,647
but it kind of sounds like you're

335
00:16:00,672 --> 00:16:02,903
just going back to
the same sort of job

336
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,630
that made you
miserable for the last 20 years.

337
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,924
No, Ralph. Don't you get
it? This is a new beginning.

338
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:10,011
- I'm gonna be a manager!
- Oh...

339
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,432
- Wow.
- Takes you back, doesn't it?

340
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,559
Listen, before
everyone gets here tomorrow,

341
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,768
I have a couple notes on the script.

342
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,438
Too many "yowza-yowza
bo-bowzas," or not enough?

343
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,106
No. On page 18,

344
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,901
Ethan and the Horse try to get
Julia to put on the roller skates,

345
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,068
and she runs out of the room crying,

346
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,904
and then, the Horse
says, "That went well."

347
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,313
Anything about that feel weird to you?

348
00:16:30,338 --> 00:16:32,349
No, see, the Horse is being sarcastic.

349
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,495
It didn't go well. So, when the Horse
says, "That went well," it's funny.

350
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,747
- Dramatic irony.
- No, I get the irony.

351
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,583
That's not the issue. This
is a guaranteed laugh.

352
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,227
You're giving me the cut to commercial.

353
00:16:42,248 --> 00:16:43,570
And that's a problem for you?

354
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:47,673
This is Ethan Around. It's your show,
and we need to tell the audience that.

355
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,843
- You can't give all the best jokes to me.
- I don't know, BoJack.

356
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,346
You really think I'm
ready for a "That went well"?

357
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,556
- You tell me. Let's hear it.
- That went well!

358
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,059
You're pushing too hard. The
line's funny. Trust the line.

359
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:58,695
That went well.

360
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,377
Great. Now let me
hear you throw it away.

361
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,856
- Oh, like a... That went well.
- Yes, that was great!

362
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,691
And that was a great
look, with the eyebrow.

363
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,485
- What if we both did that?
- Yeah, yeah.

364
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,611
I'm looking at you like,

365
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,113
"This parenting thing is
gonna be harder than I thought,"

366
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:14,242
and you're looking at me like, "Now
you see what I had to go through."

367
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,369
- Exactly. Let's try it.
- Well, that went well.

368
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,286
Hmm...

369
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,039
- Oh, my God. Chills.
- Yeah, you feel that?

370
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,208
- Yeah.
- Now that's how you cut to commercial.

371
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,751
That actually went well.

372
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:31,425
This place has really gone
downhill since they got that new chef.

373
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,262
As I was saying, I don't think the
site needs to be just one thing.

374
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:37,848
I think it can be a big
umbrella, but, like, also not an umbrella.

375
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,016
That's GirlCroosh.

376
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,851
Sorry, did you say "croosh"?

377
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,563
Oh, you do not need to
apologize here, Diane.

378
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,983
"Sorry" is a crutch and
"crutch" is an ableist term.

379
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,318
I'm sorry if that shocks you, but
I will not apologize for it.

380
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,821
So, can I ask what the
business model is here?

381
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,283
Diane, I'm rich. I'm not
doing this to make money.

382
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,994
I'm doing this to make
connections with real women

383
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,204
and extend my personal brand
as a real down-to-earth chica

384
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:01,368
who cares about real women.

385
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:02,915
Well, you know what's
great about that is,

386
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,959
if you're not beholden to ad
revenue, your writers can...

387
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:08,838
Yes! That is exactly the idea,
whatever you were about to say.

388
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,340
I want to give you a
real support system,

389
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:15,928
because, honestly,
Diane, what you do is so croosh.

390
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,389
That shit you said about Hank
Hippopopalous last year

391
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,850
was supernova red hot badass.

392
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,936
It wasn't even on
fleek. Fleek was on it.

393
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,708
Thank you.

394
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:26,796
One thing though. Is
anything off limits?

395
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:30,693
Like, if you had to write a piece about
your husband, could you do it?

396
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,778
- Why would I have to do that?
- I don't know.

397
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,239
Because his company is
basically Hooters on wheels?

398
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:38,367
- He's actually selling that company.
- Well, he's still a public figure.

399
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,494
What if Mr. Peanutbutter
does something problematic

400
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:41,738
and you have a real hot take?

401
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,344
If I have a problem
with my husband, I'm

402
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:44,809
gonna talk to him about it directly.

403
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,585
Okay, so what if you did
that and he didn't listen,

404
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,046
and you knew that, as
much as you love him

405
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:54,717
and as much as he loves
you, he's never gonna get it?

406
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,845
And meanwhile, you also knew that
all your readers looked up to you

407
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,431
and wanted to read your opinion?

408
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,016
Would you write about it then?

409
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,811
- You got the job?
- I got the job!

410
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,521
Oh, my God! Can you believe it?

411
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:10,107
In the same week, I sell a
company for millions of dollars

412
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:12,401
and you get a job writing for a blog.

413
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,612
When it rains, it pours, huh?

414
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:21,702
And over here is where you
can keep all of your receipts,

415
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,288
in your leaning tower of receipts.

416
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,249
I think my client can
handle it from here.

417
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,329
This meeting is just to give you and

418
00:19:29,354 --> 00:19:31,403
the other former
partners your money.

419
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:34,006
- Sign here.
- Okay.

420
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,884
And here's your check. That's
all this needed to be.

421
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,135
Whoa!

422
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,221
This is for eight million dollars.

423
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,224
Well, you are a one-third
owner. What did you expect?

424
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:47,895
Todd, as a millionaire? That'll
lead to some interesting stories.

425
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,794
What an exciting development.

426
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:51,381
How's that gonna change the dynamic?

427
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,652
- I guess we're gonna find out, right?
- You can leave now.

428
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,697
Hooray! Todd's in the one percent.

429
00:19:58,489 --> 00:19:59,865
Oh, uh...

430
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,784
- Hey.
- Hi.

431
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:10,042
Julia, this ice cream is only for
girls who try on their roller skates.

432
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:14,755
- So, what do you say?
- Uh, I'm gonna swipe left on that idea.

433
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,550
Cut! We got a lighting issue.

434
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,928
What? I'll be in my trailer.

435
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,347
- Hey, Chloe, that was really funny.
- Thanks.

436
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:24,551
- Are you having
fun? - Mm-hmm.

437
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,817
You got any friends in the audience?

438
00:20:26,842 --> 00:20:29,419
No friends, but my
mommy and my daddy.

439
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,189
Oh. You want to know a
secret about your mommy and daddy?

440
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,942
- What?
- They are really proud of you.

441
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,902
Oh, I know that.

442
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,029
What do you want to be
when you grow up, Chloe?

443
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:42,241
What do you mean? I want to be like you.

444
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,035
- Like me?
- I want to be famous.

445
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,662
Oh, no.

446
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,790
- BoJack?
-  Oh, God.

447
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:52,084
- Is everything okay?
- I can't be here.

448
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,919
I can't do this again. This isn't right.

449
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,283
- What do you mean?
- I need to go.

450
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,017
We need to shoot the
rest of this episode.

451
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,633
I'm sorry. I just...
I don't belong here.

452
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:00,760
Where are you going?

453
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:03,846
I don't know.

454
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,541
So, what are you gonna do with
your eight million dollars?

455
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:36,712
First, I'm gonna get a really
fancy hat, like, really fancy.

456
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,381
Then, I'm gonna get a T-shirt that
says, "Hey, look at my hat."

457
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,217
What about you?

458
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,803
I've always wanted to go
to a super nice restaurant

459
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,679
and order everything on the menu.

460
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,599
Oh, yeah! That's, like, first
day millionaire stuff.

461
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,185
We should go sometime, together.

462
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,313
- Todd, can I ask you something?
- Of course.

463
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,482
What's your deal?

464
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,068
I feel like you like
me, but you don't like me,

465
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,820
but you like me, and I
don't know what that is.

466
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:01,987
Are you gay?

467
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,363
Whoa. Why would you even...?

468
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,557
You can tell me if you're gay. It's fine.

469
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,828
This isn't the 1600s, or
some places in the present.

470
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:12,456
I'm not gay. I mean, I don't think I am,

471
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,501
but... I don't think
I'm straight, either.

472
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,087
I don't know what I am.

473
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,297
I think I might be nothing.

474
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:23,050
- Oh. Well, that's okay.
- Yeah?

475
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,760
Yeah, of course.

476
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,222
Thank you so much.

477
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,686
Oh, crap! I accidentally tipped the
waitress eight million dollars!

478
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,854
Well, guess I'm broke again.

479
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,493
Who could that be?

480
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:50,411
Pizza?

481
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,247
Katrina, you're not pizza.

482
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,040
Ugh. This fight again?

483
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:58,586
Listen, butt-sniffer, I work for
a guy and we're looking for a guy.

484
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,671
You're supposed to be this big hero now,

485
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,715
so someone brought your
name up in a meeting,

486
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,466
and, now, I have an opportunity for you.

487
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,058
Oh, is it being married to you

488
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,244
again? Because I'd
rather get euthanized.

489
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,888
Spoiler alert from Marley & Me.

490
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,182
That wasn't a spoiler until
you said the name of the movie.

491
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,538
If you've got a gig for me, you

492
00:23:13,563 --> 00:23:14,876
can go through my new manager.

493
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,396
Oh, I'm not talking about a gig.

494
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,741
Then what are you talking about?

495
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:21,966
Oh, my God, this is so classic Katrina!

496
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:25,112
How would you like to be the governor?

497
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,905
Whoa.

498
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,866
- Of California?
- Yes, of California.

499
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,452
Who's at the door? Is it pizza?

500
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,831
Welcome back. Your
first meeting's at 10:00,

501
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,249
and you have a lunch at 11:30.

502
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,373
- Thank you, Judah.
- Also, I have someone on line two

503
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,878
trying to get in
touch with BoJack Horseman.

504
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,356
I have no idea how she got this

505
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:44,405
number. It sounds like
it's a teenage girl.

506
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,717
Tell her I don't work for BoJack.

507
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,761
Mm-hmm. I'm sorry. We can't help you.

508
00:25:00,693 --> 00:25:06,605
