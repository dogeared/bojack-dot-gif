1
00:00:11,383 --> 00:00:15,346
So... should we talk about
how you just tried to kiss me?

2
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:17,181
No, I don't think we
need to talk about that.

3
00:00:17,264 --> 00:00:20,184
Yeah, you're right. What's
to talk about, right?

4
00:00:20,267 --> 00:00:22,436
We're f-friends, right?

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,229
- Oh, yeah, totally.
- Yeah, friends.

6
00:00:24,313 --> 00:00:27,024
And I think it's important
that we stay friends.

7
00:00:27,107 --> 00:00:28,609
Yeah, I agree.

8
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:30,903
And be friends with each other.

9
00:00:30,986 --> 00:00:34,072
- Yeah, friends.
- And also to each other.

10
00:00:34,156 --> 00:00:36,283
Plus, hey, you're getting married.

11
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:37,785
That's right. Next summer.

12
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:39,620
Nantucket is great in the summer.

13
00:00:39,704 --> 00:00:42,122
Not like L.A., which is so hot and dry.

14
00:00:42,206 --> 00:00:44,416
It is arid.

15
00:00:46,126 --> 00:00:47,545
Well... see you later!

16
00:00:47,628 --> 00:00:48,629
We're still a few miles...

17
00:00:48,713 --> 00:00:50,631
I'll walk. It's a beautiful night.

18
00:00:50,756 --> 00:00:53,342
Ah! Sorry, sorry!

19
00:00:53,425 --> 00:00:54,886
Shit.

20
00:00:54,968 --> 00:00:56,970
Todd, we gotta stop this wedding.

21
00:00:57,054 --> 00:00:58,055
Todd?

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,517
Aw, crap. I left him in Malibu.

23
00:01:52,852 --> 00:01:54,352

24
00:01:58,365 --> 00:02:01,660
But wait, doesn't Diane want
to marry Mr. Peanutbutter?

25
00:02:01,744 --> 00:02:05,038
No, see, she thinks she does,
but she actually doesn't.

26
00:02:05,122 --> 00:02:07,374
That's why we need to be
good friends right now,

27
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,293
and put our own feelings aside

28
00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:12,087
and sabotage our friend's engagement.

29
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,464
Oh...

30
00:02:13,547 --> 00:02:14,548
- Wait? What?
- Oh.

31
00:02:14,632 --> 00:02:16,926
I got here as soon as I
could. What's the emergency?

32
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:18,844
We got to figure out a way
to stop Diane's wedding.

33
00:02:19,177 --> 00:02:20,721
Okay.

34
00:02:20,805 --> 00:02:22,347
So when you woke me up
in the middle of the night

35
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:24,809
and told me to rush over here
because of an "emergency,"

36
00:02:24,892 --> 00:02:26,894
the emergency you were referring to

37
00:02:26,978 --> 00:02:29,271
was Diane getting married a year from now?

38
00:02:29,354 --> 00:02:31,440
- Yeah, you got any ideas?
- I'm done.

39
00:02:31,523 --> 00:02:33,567
I'm not going to waste
another thought on you.

40
00:02:33,651 --> 00:02:35,820
I am at a bar. It's the weekend.

41
00:02:35,903 --> 00:02:37,571
I'm gonna enjoy myself.

42
00:02:37,655 --> 00:02:38,864
Look, if you don't have any ideas,

43
00:02:38,948 --> 00:02:40,282
just say you don't have any ideas.

44
00:02:40,365 --> 00:02:42,242
Yoo-hoo! Buy me a drink.

45
00:02:42,326 --> 00:02:43,995
Uh, okay.

46
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:45,913
What's your name, stud?

47
00:02:45,997 --> 00:02:47,122
Vincent.

48
00:02:47,205 --> 00:02:49,834
Adult... man.

49
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:51,877
Vincent Adultman.

50
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:53,211
Ya hear that, BoJack?

51
00:02:53,295 --> 00:02:55,380
Vincent is an adult,

52
00:02:55,464 --> 00:02:57,549
and I'll bet he knows how to treat a lady.

53
00:02:57,633 --> 00:02:59,468
He very clearly isn't and doesn't.

54
00:02:59,551 --> 00:03:01,012
Would you like alcohol?

55
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:02,262
I certainly would,

56
00:03:02,346 --> 00:03:05,140
you sophisticated smooth talker.

57
00:03:05,223 --> 00:03:07,434
Mmm! Tell me all about you.

58
00:03:07,518 --> 00:03:08,769
Mm...

59
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:12,606
I like business... transactions.

60
00:03:14,191 --> 00:03:15,526
Are you seriously trying to make me jealous

61
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:17,695
by flirting with what is very obviously

62
00:03:17,778 --> 00:03:19,321
just three kids stacked on top

63
00:03:19,404 --> 00:03:20,865
of each other under a trench coat?

64
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:23,075
Vinnie, what does a
guy like you do for fun?

65
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:24,368
I don't have time for these shenanigans.

66
00:03:24,451 --> 00:03:25,995
I got a wedding to shanghai.

67
00:03:26,078 --> 00:03:27,746
Good luck with your business transactions.

68
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,831
- Thanks.
- Ugh!

69
00:03:30,415 --> 00:03:31,709
Officer.

70
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:33,669
The mail truck pulled up right next to me.

71
00:03:33,752 --> 00:03:36,254
I got a bad vibe. What
was I supposed to do?

72
00:03:36,338 --> 00:03:37,715
Not chase the mail truck?

73
00:03:37,798 --> 00:03:39,383
Mr. Peanutbutter, I'm a big fan,

74
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:42,344
so I'm gonna let you off
with a warning this time.

75
00:03:44,555 --> 00:03:45,806
♪ Dangerous ♪

76
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:46,974
- ♪ Come on ♪
- ♪ Dangerous ♪

77
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:48,559
- Aah!
- Mr. Peanutbutter!

78
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,693
Hey, honeysuckle. Great news.

79
00:03:57,776 --> 00:03:59,361
I got to ride in a police car.

80
00:03:59,444 --> 00:04:02,197
Bad news... I lost my driver's license.

81
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,407
Let me guess.

82
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,867
Were you chasing the mailman again?

83
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,577
Yeah, why? Did you see him out there too?

84
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,037
Nothing stops them.

85
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,288
Not rain, not sleet, not dead of night,

86
00:04:10,372 --> 00:04:12,541
not gates!

87
00:04:12,624 --> 00:04:14,209
Anyway, I need a little favor.

88
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:16,211
Can you... drive me everywhere I need to go

89
00:04:16,294 --> 00:04:17,880
for the next three months?

90
00:04:17,963 --> 00:04:20,382
I really can't, sweetheart. I'm super busy.

91
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:23,385
Oh, you're working on our wedding registry.

92
00:04:23,468 --> 00:04:25,596
- I'm writing my book.
- Right.

93
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:27,139
But don't forget about the registry.

94
00:04:27,222 --> 00:04:29,141
Mr. Peanutbutter, you know I love you.

95
00:04:29,224 --> 00:04:32,103
And you know I am really
excited about getting married,

96
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:33,729
but right now I'm working,

97
00:04:33,812 --> 00:04:35,188
and I have a lot of thoughts in my head,

98
00:04:35,272 --> 00:04:36,648
and I can't really think about our wedding

99
00:04:36,732 --> 00:04:37,983
or the future or me being married to you.

100
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:40,069
Okay. What's going on?

101
00:04:40,152 --> 00:04:41,528
Talk to me like I'm Michelle Pfeiffer

102
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:42,821
in the Coolio video.

103
00:04:42,905 --> 00:04:45,116
Just... Well, um... with the leg...

104
00:04:45,198 --> 00:04:46,408
Hmm, all right.

105
00:04:46,491 --> 00:04:47,785
And Coolio.

106
00:04:47,868 --> 00:04:49,244
Nothing's going on.

107
00:04:49,327 --> 00:04:50,746
It's just that this wedding is kind of

108
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:52,123
starting to feel like a lot.

109
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:54,917
Honey, relax. Getting married is easy.

110
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,835
I mean, I've already done it twice.

111
00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:58,378
It's fine. I'm sorry.

112
00:04:58,462 --> 00:05:01,799
I just... need to focus
on the book right now.

113
00:05:01,882 --> 00:05:04,509
So that's still a no on driving me around?

114
00:05:04,593 --> 00:05:06,470
- Why don't you hire a driver?
- Eh-eh-eh-deh...

115
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:08,305
Is there a light bulb above my head?

116
00:05:08,388 --> 00:05:11,266
Because while you were talking,
I just got an amazing idea.

117
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:13,185
I should hire a driver!

118
00:05:13,268 --> 00:05:15,146
Oh, this will be a romp.

119
00:05:15,228 --> 00:05:19,150
If I know me, this will be a romp.

120
00:05:22,027 --> 00:05:24,029
I'm not sure how I feel

121
00:05:24,113 --> 00:05:25,614
about breaking and entering, BoJack.

122
00:05:25,697 --> 00:05:27,158
Well, that's the beauty part.

123
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,827
The B&E is really the least illegal piece

124
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,536
of this 12-point master plan.

125
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,830
- Have you got your tool kit?
- Check.

126
00:05:32,913 --> 00:05:33,914
- Burner phone?
- Check.

127
00:05:33,998 --> 00:05:35,207
- Cyanide capsule?
- Check.

128
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,291
Wait, why do we need...

129
00:05:36,374 --> 00:05:37,793
Okay, let's get started.

130
00:05:37,876 --> 00:05:40,504
Enter the study.

131
00:05:46,135 --> 00:05:48,679
Plant incriminating...

132
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:51,223
- Hello? Todd?
- Uh...

133
00:05:51,306 --> 00:05:53,934
- Hi, Mr. Peanutbutter.
- Take the cyanide, Todd.

134
00:05:54,018 --> 00:05:55,393
Take the cyanide!

135
00:05:57,062 --> 00:05:58,480
And hup. Hup.

136
00:05:58,563 --> 00:05:59,982
And hup... No.

137
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:02,693
Are you here to interview to be my driver?

138
00:06:02,776 --> 00:06:04,903
Um... yes, I am.

139
00:06:04,987 --> 00:06:06,238
Brilliant.

140
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:07,781
I didn't even post the ad yet.

141
00:06:07,865 --> 00:06:09,908
Here's me thinking destiny over here.

142
00:06:09,992 --> 00:06:10,993
And hup. Yeah!

143
00:06:11,076 --> 00:06:12,077
Hu-aah!

144
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,499
Thank you for your interest
in the role of driver.

145
00:06:17,582 --> 00:06:19,126
I know you don't have your resume with you,

146
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,879
so I've taken the liberty
of letting you use mine.

147
00:06:21,962 --> 00:06:23,296
Yeah, thanks.

148
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,007
Here, business boss.

149
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,718
Let's just have a look here. Mm-hmm.

150
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:29,220
Oh, ho, with a resume like this,

151
00:06:29,302 --> 00:06:31,180
you should be the one hiring a driver.

152
00:06:31,263 --> 00:06:32,681
Just kidding.

153
00:06:32,764 --> 00:06:33,891
I know it's my resume.

154
00:06:33,974 --> 00:06:35,350
But I see you went to Northwestern.

155
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:37,186
You know, I'm an N.U. man myself.

156
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:39,021
Go, fighting Westerns.

157
00:06:39,104 --> 00:06:40,397
And it says here you do

158
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,440
a great Rodney Dangerfield impression.

159
00:06:42,524 --> 00:06:43,525
Give us a taste.

160
00:06:43,608 --> 00:06:45,110
Uh, okay.

161
00:06:45,194 --> 00:06:47,238
"I'm Roger Dangerfield."

162
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,656
No respect, indeed.

163
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,868
Todd, you got the job.

164
00:06:52,951 --> 00:06:54,411
Oh.

165
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:56,621
Can you believe this weather we're having?

166
00:06:56,705 --> 00:06:59,499
No, I cannot believe
this weather we're having!

167
00:07:01,085 --> 00:07:03,087
Oh, wow. We make a great pair.

168
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,965
It's like I'm Miss Daisy,
and you're Minnie Driver.

169
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:11,511
Hey, I'm bored.

170
00:07:11,595 --> 00:07:13,513
And I think Todd swallowed a cyanide pill

171
00:07:13,597 --> 00:07:14,723
and might be dead.

172
00:07:14,806 --> 00:07:15,974
Wanna come over and bang it out?

173
00:07:16,058 --> 00:07:17,517
Appealing as that sounds,

174
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:19,394
I have lunch plans with Vincent.

175
00:07:19,477 --> 00:07:21,396
I know that might be hard for you to hear.

176
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,899
Wait, that guy from the bar
who is actually three boys

177
00:07:23,982 --> 00:07:26,026
stacked on top of each
other under a trench coat?

178
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,070
Well, don't fly into a
jealous rage about it.

179
00:07:28,153 --> 00:07:29,154
Not jealous.

180
00:07:29,238 --> 00:07:30,614
Just reminding you that you are trying

181
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:32,116
to have a relationship
with someone who is...

182
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,284
and again, it's bizarre

183
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:35,452
I should have to point
this out... three young boys

184
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:37,746
stacked on top of each
other under a trench coat.

185
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:39,831
He listens to me.

186
00:07:39,915 --> 00:07:41,541
Okay, okay, but can you
just acknowledge that...

187
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:42,876
- That you are being jealous?
- Oh, oh!

188
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,211
Already acknowledged.

189
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:45,796
Toodles.

190
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,965
- Look who's not dead.
- Better than not dead.

191
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:51,176
You are looking at
Mr.Peanutbutter's new driver.

192
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,470
You're his driver? That's perfect.

193
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:56,431
Now you can infiltrate Mr.
Peanutbutter's inner circle.

194
00:07:56,514 --> 00:07:58,267
I don't know, BoJack.

195
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,517
Sure, you'll act all friendly,

196
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:01,312
gain his trust, chauffer him around

197
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:03,521
on his little errands to
the groomer and whatnot,

198
00:08:03,605 --> 00:08:05,690
but all the while, you'll be studying him,

199
00:08:05,774 --> 00:08:07,484
scouring out his weaknesses,

200
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:10,362
biding your time till
we're ready to strike.

201
00:08:10,445 --> 00:08:12,948
And once you zero in on his Achilles' heel,

202
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:17,202
we will take... him... down.

203
00:08:17,286 --> 00:08:20,122
Hooray. Betrayal.

204
00:08:24,084 --> 00:08:25,294
Oh, man. Oh, man.

205
00:08:25,377 --> 00:08:26,711
- Keep it cool, Todd.
- Hey, pal.

206
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:28,546
If you're making small talk up there,

207
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,008
how about sending a little my way?

208
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:33,969
Um... can you believe
this weather we're having?

209
00:08:34,052 --> 00:08:38,640
No, I cannot believe
this weather we're having!

210
00:08:42,102 --> 00:08:43,103
Hey, weren't you supposed to be here

211
00:08:43,187 --> 00:08:44,604
like a half hour ago?

212
00:08:44,688 --> 00:08:47,149
Yeah, I've just been sitting in my car.

213
00:08:48,566 --> 00:08:50,485
Listen, I was looking over my notes,

214
00:08:50,568 --> 00:08:52,612
and I think I have enough
to go write the book,

215
00:08:52,696 --> 00:08:56,867
so... I'm just going to do that.

216
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,869
You don't want to interview me anymore?

217
00:08:58,952 --> 00:09:00,787
But don't you want to
know what my Rosebud is?

218
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:02,914
You told me repeatedly
it was the nudie magazine

219
00:09:02,998 --> 00:09:04,624
your uncle showed you with
the three-nippled woman.

220
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,626
- Who was she?
- I got it all.

221
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,752
Oh, okay.

222
00:09:07,836 --> 00:09:09,629
Well, I'll see you around though, right?

223
00:09:09,713 --> 00:09:12,216
Yeah. I, um...

224
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:15,093
Why did you have to make
things weird, BoJack?

225
00:09:18,596 --> 00:09:20,932
I made things weird?

226
00:09:21,016 --> 00:09:22,809
So if you see anything

227
00:09:22,893 --> 00:09:24,644
you know we need, like this biscuit warmer,

228
00:09:24,728 --> 00:09:26,563
you just run the laser over the barcode,

229
00:09:26,646 --> 00:09:27,647
and kablamsky!

230
00:09:27,731 --> 00:09:29,066
It goes in the registry.

231
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:30,608
And that way, everybody knows what I want.

232
00:09:30,692 --> 00:09:32,319
- And I know what I want.
- Uh...

233
00:09:32,403 --> 00:09:33,778
Which is what everyone wants.

234
00:09:33,862 --> 00:09:35,155
And it's really clear,

235
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,781
and nobody's confused about anything.

236
00:09:36,865 --> 00:09:39,451
Am I crazy, or are you not into this?

237
00:09:39,534 --> 00:09:41,703
No, I am. It's just...

238
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:44,664
The big wedding in Nantucket,
all these presents...

239
00:09:44,748 --> 00:09:46,541
I'm so overwhelmed, I can barely consider

240
00:09:46,624 --> 00:09:49,044
whether I want or need a biscuit warmer,

241
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:50,921
which I think is how people
end up with biscuit warmers.

242
00:09:51,004 --> 00:09:53,090
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

243
00:09:53,173 --> 00:09:54,883
Close your eyes. Come on.

244
00:09:54,966 --> 00:09:56,676
Okay, picture our lives together.

245
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,054
It's a cold Sunday morning
a bunch of years from now.

246
00:09:59,137 --> 00:10:01,223
Maybe robots have taken
over, maybe they haven't.

247
00:10:01,306 --> 00:10:02,349
I don't know. It's the future.

248
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:03,934
This story isn't about that.

249
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:05,894
The important thing is it's Sunday morning.

250
00:10:05,977 --> 00:10:08,439
I brought you the paper,
fetched your slippers.

251
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:11,649
You come into the kitchen...
Can you smell biscuits?

252
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:14,069
- Yes.
- So can I.

253
00:10:14,152 --> 00:10:15,695
- Are they warm?
- Yeah.

254
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,781
Well, that's all a biscuit warmer's for.

255
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:19,699
Look, if marriage stresses you out,

256
00:10:19,783 --> 00:10:21,326
we don't have to get married.

257
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,827
It's not the marriage.

258
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:25,497
It's the wedding and the year of build-up.

259
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,998
So forget all that.

260
00:10:27,082 --> 00:10:28,208
I've done the whole big wedding thing.

261
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:29,667
I don't need to do it again.

262
00:10:29,751 --> 00:10:31,420
Let's do something small and casual

263
00:10:31,503 --> 00:10:33,004
right here in town next month.

264
00:10:33,088 --> 00:10:35,340
Honestly, that would be amazing.

265
00:10:35,424 --> 00:10:37,092
But we'd have to cancel the doves,

266
00:10:37,175 --> 00:10:38,593
and we wouldn't be able to send out

267
00:10:38,676 --> 00:10:40,095
those fancy invitations you liked.

268
00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:42,139
Those doves were being jerks anyway.

269
00:10:42,222 --> 00:10:43,932
And invitations... They're just a scam

270
00:10:44,015 --> 00:10:46,393
made up by the Post
Office to keep tabs on us.

271
00:10:46,477 --> 00:10:47,602
Post Office.

272
00:10:47,685 --> 00:10:49,438
Settle down, boy.

273
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:52,565
And then we talked about
his favorite Smash Mouth CDs.

274
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:54,818
And... Oh, oh.

275
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:58,113
And then that led to a whole
conversations about sticks.

276
00:10:58,196 --> 00:11:00,157
Oh, and let me tell you,

277
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,411
Mr. Peanutbutter has got some
serious opinions about sticks.

278
00:11:04,495 --> 00:11:05,954
Why are you telling me this?

279
00:11:06,037 --> 00:11:07,580
What? You said you wanted every detail.

280
00:11:07,664 --> 00:11:09,082
Did I mention he got a new bandana?

281
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,417
Give me something I can use

282
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:11,918
to make them call off their wedding.

283
00:11:12,002 --> 00:11:13,504
Oh, yeah. Did I not tell you?

284
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:14,712
They called off their wedding.

285
00:11:14,796 --> 00:11:16,589
What? Thank God!

286
00:11:16,673 --> 00:11:18,716
Oh, the universe makes sense.

287
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,511
They decided against a
big destination wedding,

288
00:11:20,593 --> 00:11:21,719
so they're doing it here

289
00:11:21,803 --> 00:11:22,971
- sometime next month.
- What?

290
00:11:23,096 --> 00:11:24,556
I guess saying they called it off

291
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:25,890
is probably not right.

292
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:30,645
Hey, what's this?

293
00:11:30,728 --> 00:11:32,730
Oh, yes, I got jury duty,

294
00:11:32,814 --> 00:11:34,065
but I can't worry about that right now.

295
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:35,608
That is a problem for Friday BoJack.

296
00:11:35,692 --> 00:11:37,944
Now think, Todd. Gotta
have something I can use

297
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:40,489
sloshing around in that
pot-infused Jell-O shot

298
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:42,366
- you call a brain.
- Let's see.

299
00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:45,994
Mr. Peanutbutter likes
having his tummy scratched,

300
00:11:46,077 --> 00:11:47,996
and Diane's family is from Vietnam,

301
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,375
which is where Vietnamese food comes from,

302
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,751
and since that goes in your tummy...

303
00:11:53,835 --> 00:11:55,379
Okay, stop thinking. Just give me raw data.

304
00:11:55,462 --> 00:11:56,588
What's happening this week?

305
00:11:56,671 --> 00:11:58,298
Well, the circus is in town.

306
00:11:58,382 --> 00:12:00,175
Congress is going to vote
on the new Education Bill...

307
00:12:00,258 --> 00:12:01,593
With Mr. Peanutbutter!

308
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:02,927
What's happening with Mr. Peanutbutter?

309
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:05,222
Well, I'm taking Diane and him

310
00:12:05,305 --> 00:12:06,890
to the bank on Thursday.

311
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:10,018
I can use that. I can actually use that.

312
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,271
I don't know if I'm up

313
00:12:13,355 --> 00:12:15,566
for staging a bank robbery, BoJack.

314
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:18,735
Oh, come on, character
actress Margo Martindale.

315
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:19,944
They say that there are no good parts

316
00:12:20,028 --> 00:12:21,321
for women over 50.

317
00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:22,614
I want to stick an AK-47

318
00:12:22,697 --> 00:12:24,324
in your hand and prove them wrong.

319
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:26,117
I do tire of the limitations

320
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:27,911
of stage, film, and television.

321
00:12:27,994 --> 00:12:29,787
You might as well perform
in a cage, am I right?

322
00:12:29,871 --> 00:12:31,248
This is guerilla theater...

323
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:33,333
No stage, no script, no net.

324
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:35,043
It's the kind of work we talked about

325
00:12:35,126 --> 00:12:37,045
doing that night in the desert.

326
00:12:37,128 --> 00:12:39,631
Don't tell me we left those
dreams in the sweat lodge.

327
00:12:39,714 --> 00:12:41,592
Hell, I'll do it.

328
00:12:43,051 --> 00:12:45,429
And that little boy never found his mother.

329
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:46,471
Hey, guys.

330
00:12:46,597 --> 00:12:47,972
BoJack Horseman?

331
00:12:48,056 --> 00:12:49,349
Oh. Hi.

332
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:50,642
What a weird coincidence.

333
00:12:50,725 --> 00:12:52,227
I did not know you would be here today.

334
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,521
How are... things?

335
00:12:54,605 --> 00:12:55,897
Things are good. You?

336
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,315
Things good with you?

337
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:58,567
Hands behind your head, everybody.

338
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,902
Nobody moves, nobody gets shot.

339
00:13:00,985 --> 00:13:03,154
What an unfortunate surprise.

340
00:13:03,238 --> 00:13:05,365
Well, well, isn't that a pretty ring?

341
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:06,866
This one.

342
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,244
Well, well, isn't that a pretty ring?

343
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:10,621
I'll take it.

344
00:13:10,703 --> 00:13:11,996
But it's my engagement ring.

345
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,331
Give it to her, Diane.

346
00:13:13,415 --> 00:13:15,041
- It's just a ring.
- Just a ring?

347
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,335
That ring is a symbol of your love.

348
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:19,170
If you don't care about the ring,

349
00:13:19,254 --> 00:13:21,214
it really makes me wonder if you care about

350
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:22,924
the woman wearing it.

351
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:24,259
That terrifying bank robber

352
00:13:24,342 --> 00:13:26,219
is making some very cogent points.

353
00:13:26,303 --> 00:13:27,845
No, Mr. Peanutbutter's right.

354
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:30,223
If the ring is just a symbol for love,

355
00:13:30,307 --> 00:13:31,600
why would I need a symbol

356
00:13:31,683 --> 00:13:33,310
when I have the real thing right here?

357
00:13:33,393 --> 00:13:35,479
Yeah, we don't need
rings, we have each other.

358
00:13:35,562 --> 00:13:38,106
Hey, why are we even waiting
a month to get married?

359
00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:40,692
If anything, this bank
robbery is reminding me

360
00:13:40,775 --> 00:13:42,319
that life is short.

361
00:13:42,402 --> 00:13:43,861
We should get married even sooner!

362
00:13:43,945 --> 00:13:45,071
No...

363
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:46,239
What do you mean sooner?

364
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:47,407
Why not this weekend?

365
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:49,284
We could get married Saturday.

366
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:50,577
Am I crazy?

367
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:52,329
Yes. Don't do it.

368
00:13:52,412 --> 00:13:54,956
- Oh, keep the damn thing.
- Aw.

369
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,293
Okay. Saturday it is.

370
00:13:58,376 --> 00:13:59,628
What the hell just happened?

371
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:01,588
Something truly beauti...

372
00:14:01,672 --> 00:14:02,714
Aah!

373
00:14:02,797 --> 00:14:03,965
- Oh.
- Get your hands off me!

374
00:14:04,048 --> 00:14:05,049
- - Uh-oh.

375
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:09,887
Long story short,

376
00:14:10,013 --> 00:14:11,598
Erica did have to lose the foot,

377
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:13,975
but she gained a friend.

378
00:14:14,058 --> 00:14:15,852
Sorry, kind of went off on a tangent there.

379
00:14:15,935 --> 00:14:17,395
Diane and I wanna thank you all

380
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:19,814
for coming to our
impromptu rehearsal dinner,

381
00:14:19,897 --> 00:14:21,692
even though we did not actually have time

382
00:14:21,774 --> 00:14:23,943
- to organize a rehearsal.
- Or a dinner.

383
00:14:24,027 --> 00:14:26,237
But there is an open bar...

384
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,324
which you are all welcome to partake in

385
00:14:29,407 --> 00:14:31,159
as soon as I finish this toast,

386
00:14:31,242 --> 00:14:34,538
which I will be doing right...

387
00:14:34,621 --> 00:14:35,913
after one more quick anecdote.

388
00:14:35,997 --> 00:14:37,374
It was winter in Prague,

389
00:14:37,457 --> 00:14:39,209
and the consumption hung low in the air.

390
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:40,418
Well, the bank thing was a dud.

391
00:14:40,502 --> 00:14:41,753
Thanks a lot, Todd.

392
00:14:41,836 --> 00:14:43,213
Well, you win some, you lose some.

393
00:14:43,296 --> 00:14:44,715
It's like Vincent always says...

394
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:46,090
- "Oopsy."
- Vincent?

395
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:47,509
Yeah, Princess Carolyn's boyfriend.

396
00:14:47,592 --> 00:14:49,093
We've hung out a couple times.

397
00:14:49,177 --> 00:14:50,887
- What are you ta...
- That dude is funny.

398
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,597
You know he's not a person, right?

399
00:14:52,681 --> 00:14:53,890
Look, I don't want to get

400
00:14:53,973 --> 00:14:55,099
in the middle of your whole thing

401
00:14:55,183 --> 00:14:56,351
with Princess Carolyn.

402
00:14:56,434 --> 00:14:57,686
It's not about that.

403
00:14:57,769 --> 00:14:58,936
I just don't understand why nobody else

404
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,480
seems to notice that she is dating a man

405
00:15:00,564 --> 00:15:01,939
who is clearly three little boys

406
00:15:02,023 --> 00:15:04,025
doing the thing from The Little Rascals.

407
00:15:04,108 --> 00:15:05,985
Oh, that reminds me of another funny story.

408
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:08,029
If I could say a few words?

409
00:15:08,112 --> 00:15:10,365
BoJack Horseman. Take the mic.

410
00:15:10,448 --> 00:15:11,742
Spin us a yarn.

411
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:13,368
Mr. Peanutbutter, Diane.

412
00:15:13,451 --> 00:15:14,911
Since I am friends with both of you

413
00:15:14,994 --> 00:15:16,954
- and have no ulterior motives...
- Mm-hmm.

414
00:15:17,038 --> 00:15:18,373
I would like to offer my restaurant

415
00:15:18,456 --> 00:15:19,791
as a venue for your wedding.

416
00:15:19,874 --> 00:15:21,459
Wow! Really?

417
00:15:21,543 --> 00:15:23,420
I don't know. That's too generous.

418
00:15:23,503 --> 00:15:26,548
Hey, don't look a horse's
gift in the mouth, right?

419
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,884
I get it. Like the song.

420
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:30,968
That's not a song.

421
00:15:31,052 --> 00:15:32,387
All right, everyone.

422
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,638
That's it for the toasts.

423
00:15:33,722 --> 00:15:36,433
Enjoy yourselves and each other.

424
00:15:38,476 --> 00:15:39,936
This is perfect.

425
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:41,688
Now that the wedding's at my restaurant,

426
00:15:41,772 --> 00:15:43,648
we have the home field advantage.

427
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:45,233
Perfect for sabotage.

428
00:15:45,316 --> 00:15:47,402
BoJack, I need to thank you.

429
00:15:47,485 --> 00:15:49,613
You calling me to the bar the other night

430
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:50,905
turned out to be the best thing

431
00:15:50,988 --> 00:15:52,073
that ever happened to me.

432
00:15:52,156 --> 00:15:53,617
- I think I'm in love.
- Okay.

433
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,201
This "person" you're in love with...

434
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:56,953
Have you seen him without
his trench coat on?

435
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:58,747
I don't understand why
you can't be happy for me.

436
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,331
He's a good boyfriend.

437
00:16:00,415 --> 00:16:01,916
I actually think you and Vincent

438
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:04,168
would really hit it off
if you gave him a chance.

439
00:16:04,252 --> 00:16:06,087
You should spend some
one-on-one time with him.

440
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,505
You mean
one-on-three time?

441
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:09,173
Because there are three of him.

442
00:16:09,257 --> 00:16:11,092
We get it. You don't like him.

443
00:16:11,175 --> 00:16:12,636
I'm actually not sure you do get it.

444
00:16:14,262 --> 00:16:16,139
I know what's been going on.

445
00:16:16,222 --> 00:16:17,557
Ah! I wasn't gonna pee.

446
00:16:17,641 --> 00:16:18,975
I was just taking my penis out.

447
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:20,685
You've been driving me around,

448
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:22,687
but there was something else
happening the whole time.

449
00:16:22,771 --> 00:16:23,855
I see it now.

450
00:16:23,938 --> 00:16:25,774
What are you talking about?

451
00:16:25,857 --> 00:16:28,777
You weren't just working
as my driver, Todd.

452
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,362
You were becoming my friend.

453
00:16:31,446 --> 00:16:33,782
Oh, yeah. That was happening.

454
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:35,784
Well, I could use a friend right about now.

455
00:16:35,867 --> 00:16:37,786
There's something I really
gotta get off my chest,

456
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:41,414
and if it got out, it could
destroy the whole wedding.

457
00:16:41,498 --> 00:16:43,958
No, I'm not great with
sensitive information.

458
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,002
I don't know if I'm ready
to get married again.

459
00:16:46,085 --> 00:16:48,921
Don't get me wrong. I love Diane so much.

460
00:16:49,005 --> 00:16:50,089
I didn't have any doubts

461
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:52,342
until I realized she had doubts.

462
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:54,719
Then I figured she's smarter than I am.

463
00:16:54,803 --> 00:16:56,137
Maybe she knows things I don't.

464
00:16:56,262 --> 00:16:57,639
You are kind of unloading

465
00:16:57,764 --> 00:16:59,683
a lot of sensitive information here.

466
00:16:59,766 --> 00:17:01,768
Sure, I think I'm ready to commit to Diane,

467
00:17:01,852 --> 00:17:04,020
but I can't even commit to
my favorite type of stick.

468
00:17:04,103 --> 00:17:07,357
Yes, today, it's short
and knobby, but tomorrow?

469
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,026
Well, sure, Diane is short,
but I don't know about knobby.

470
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:12,111
The last thing I want to do is hurt Diane,

471
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:14,405
but I keep having this
dream where she's gone.

472
00:17:14,489 --> 00:17:16,115
There's no break-up, no tragedy.

473
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,576
She's just gone, and my
life continues without her.

474
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,328
And it terrifies me to say this,

475
00:17:20,411 --> 00:17:23,206
but in the dream I feel... relief.

476
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:25,750
Hey, thanks for listening to all this.

477
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:27,502
You're a really good friend, Todd.

478
00:17:29,253 --> 00:17:31,172
Since you weren't able to
give me any useful intel,

479
00:17:31,255 --> 00:17:32,924
I had to offer up my restaurant,

480
00:17:33,007 --> 00:17:35,176
but now, we're on my turf.

481
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:37,679
Time for operation "I don't."

482
00:17:37,762 --> 00:17:39,556
Yeah, sounds good.

483
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:40,849
You know, with my knack

484
00:17:40,932 --> 00:17:43,017
for coming up with plans and your ability

485
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,435
to hear them without contributing

486
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:46,145
more than three words at a time,

487
00:17:46,229 --> 00:17:47,898
we make a pretty good team, don't we, Todd?

488
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,024
- You said it.
- See?

489
00:17:51,776 --> 00:17:53,862
Beloved character
actress Margo Martindale

490
00:17:53,945 --> 00:17:55,321
is in police custody tonight

491
00:17:55,405 --> 00:17:57,574
for her role in a failed bank robbery.

492
00:17:57,657 --> 00:17:59,075
Margo Martindale?

493
00:17:59,158 --> 00:18:01,369
But first, pizza for breakfast?

494
00:18:01,452 --> 00:18:03,413
The answer might surprise you.

495
00:18:03,496 --> 00:18:07,918
I know her, but how? Wait.

496
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,377
She was at the convenience store

497
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,170
the night I bought that video game

498
00:18:11,254 --> 00:18:13,130
and ruined my rock opera.

499
00:18:13,214 --> 00:18:14,883
She's the one who asked me

500
00:18:14,966 --> 00:18:18,010
to hand her that tape from the 10¢ bin.

501
00:18:18,094 --> 00:18:22,682
That means Margo
Martindale likes tapes!

502
00:18:22,766 --> 00:18:24,642
And a tape is something you listen to,

503
00:18:24,726 --> 00:18:26,477
but tape is also a sticky thing

504
00:18:26,561 --> 00:18:28,438
you can use to seal boxes.

505
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:30,941
Boxes is what cereal comes in.

506
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:33,610
What does it all mean?

507
00:18:33,693 --> 00:18:35,486
Am I just grasping at straws?

508
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:38,740
Wait. Straws... That's it.

509
00:18:38,823 --> 00:18:42,243
Straws are used to drink soda or water,

510
00:18:42,326 --> 00:18:43,870
and plants need water.

511
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:48,332
And BoJack used Margo Martindale as a plant

512
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:53,212
at the bank and the convenience store,

513
00:18:53,296 --> 00:18:55,799
which means... Ugh!

514
00:18:55,882 --> 00:18:58,760
BoJack hired Margo Martindale

515
00:18:58,843 --> 00:19:00,762
to make me find that video game

516
00:19:00,845 --> 00:19:05,016
so he could kill my rock opera!

517
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:06,517
Aw, dude.

518
00:19:09,437 --> 00:19:12,482
- Rise and shine, Todd.
- I didn't sleep.

519
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:14,191
Well, we're down to the
wire, but we still got

520
00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:16,152
one more day to figure out
how to stop this wedding,

521
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:18,488
and I can't afford to waste
one second, so let's get...

522
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:20,490
Oh, shit. Forgot about jury duty.

523
00:19:20,573 --> 00:19:22,074
Damn you, Tuesday BoJack.

524
00:19:25,954 --> 00:19:30,166
- And so, you saw the defendant.
- Yes.

525
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:34,045
That man, the defendant... You saw him?

526
00:19:34,128 --> 00:19:35,672
Come on, come on, come on. Hurry up.

527
00:19:35,755 --> 00:19:39,634
- That's correct.
- The defendant was seen by you.

528
00:19:39,717 --> 00:19:40,885
Sweet Jesus.

529
00:19:40,969 --> 00:19:42,470
Some of us have weddings to ruin.

530
00:19:42,553 --> 00:19:43,721
Yes.

531
00:19:43,805 --> 00:19:45,389
No further questions, Your Honor.

532
00:19:45,473 --> 00:19:47,684
I'm sorry. I misspoke.

533
00:19:47,767 --> 00:19:49,686
A lot of further questions.

534
00:19:56,567 --> 00:19:59,570
The jury finds the defendant
not guilty on all charges.

535
00:20:00,905 --> 00:20:02,657
We did the right thing today, BoJack.

536
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,116
But you know who the real winner is?

537
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,202
- Justice.
- Mr. Peanutbutter.

538
00:20:09,246 --> 00:20:10,247
BoJack.

539
00:20:10,331 --> 00:20:12,333
There's my superstar.

540
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,877
- How are you?
- Amazing!

541
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,170
This has been the role of a lifetime.

542
00:20:16,253 --> 00:20:18,464
I think they're gonna send me up to Lompoc,

543
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:20,842
and when I get there, I'm gonna find

544
00:20:20,925 --> 00:20:23,344
the meanest, hardest
queen bitch of the yard,

545
00:20:23,427 --> 00:20:26,056
and I'm going to bite her finger off.

546
00:20:26,138 --> 00:20:28,432
That'll show everyone I'm crazy,

547
00:20:28,516 --> 00:20:30,060
and you don't mess with crazy.

548
00:20:30,142 --> 00:20:31,561
Plus, free finger.

549
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:34,105
Oh, here I am blabbering on about my plans.

550
00:20:34,188 --> 00:20:36,148
Did you ever stop that wedding?

551
00:20:36,232 --> 00:20:37,567
It's actually happening right now.

552
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,193
I ran out of time.

553
00:20:39,276 --> 00:20:40,611
I never understood why

554
00:20:40,695 --> 00:20:42,363
it was so important to
keep those two apart.

555
00:20:42,446 --> 00:20:43,865
I was just trying to be a good friend

556
00:20:43,948 --> 00:20:46,826
in my own shitty, ass-backwards way.

557
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,578
Diane deserves the best.

558
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:50,371
She's smart and kind and beautiful,

559
00:20:50,454 --> 00:20:52,916
and it's gonna be mostly
synonyms from here on

560
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:54,751
if I keep going,

561
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:56,669
and I'm in love with her.

562
00:20:56,753 --> 00:20:58,379
Tell her that, BoJack.

563
00:20:58,462 --> 00:21:01,507
You don't need kooky
schemes or nutty capers.

564
00:21:01,591 --> 00:21:04,719
Just go to her and speak from your heart.

565
00:21:04,802 --> 00:21:07,597
Then find the biggest person at the wedding

566
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,348
and bite his finger off!

567
00:21:09,432 --> 00:21:11,142
You're right, partly.

568
00:21:11,225 --> 00:21:13,061
I've gotta tell her how I feel.

569
00:21:13,144 --> 00:21:14,938
Okay, I'm gonna do it.

570
00:21:15,021 --> 00:21:16,773
Good luck with your finger thing.

571
00:21:20,317 --> 00:21:21,694
Todd, thank God you're here!

572
00:21:21,778 --> 00:21:23,029
Did I miss it? Is it too late?

573
00:21:23,113 --> 00:21:24,655
Dude. I'm done with this. No. No.

574
00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:26,449
Mr. Peanutbutter's been nice to me.

575
00:21:26,532 --> 00:21:27,784
Mr. Peanutbutter is nice to everybody.

576
00:21:27,867 --> 00:21:29,243
That's what makes him so stupid.

577
00:21:29,326 --> 00:21:31,245
No, I'm stupid.

578
00:21:31,328 --> 00:21:33,623
But even I know that the only reason

579
00:21:33,706 --> 00:21:35,959
you're doing this is because
you're in love with Diane.

580
00:21:36,042 --> 00:21:37,460
Yes, that's right.

581
00:21:37,543 --> 00:21:39,336
And I'm here to finally
tell her how I feel.

582
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,131
BoJack, she knows how you feel.

583
00:21:41,213 --> 00:21:43,174
How? I barely just realized...

584
00:21:43,257 --> 00:21:45,593
Hey, man, she made her choice.

585
00:21:45,676 --> 00:21:49,889
Look around. This day
is not about you, okay?

586
00:21:49,973 --> 00:21:52,600
So maybe you should just stop trying

587
00:21:52,683 --> 00:21:55,728
to mess with other people's lives.

588
00:21:55,812 --> 00:21:58,314
I never thought
I wanted to get married.

589
00:21:58,397 --> 00:21:59,857
It's so weird,

590
00:21:59,941 --> 00:22:02,026
this idea of dedicating
yourself to something

591
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,277
for the rest of your life.

592
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,822
Like, how could you know, right?

593
00:22:05,905 --> 00:22:09,325
But then I realized it's
okay to not know everything.

594
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,702
And some things take a leap of faith.

595
00:22:11,786 --> 00:22:14,413
Mr. Peanutbutter, I want
to take that leap with you.

596
00:22:14,497 --> 00:22:17,416
By the power vested in me by
one of those dumb websites,

597
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,085
I now pronounce you married.

598
00:22:19,169 --> 00:22:21,504
Go ahead. Kiss, you lovesick dummies.

599
00:22:24,548 --> 00:22:26,092
♪ Ow! ♪

600
00:22:30,138 --> 00:22:32,932
♪ Mmm-yeah ♪

601
00:22:33,016 --> 00:22:34,517
♪ I used to think maybe... ♪

602
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,019
Hey, Todd. Todd.

603
00:22:36,102 --> 00:22:37,561
Thanks for hearing me out the other night.

604
00:22:37,645 --> 00:22:39,189
I'm really glad I went through with this.

605
00:22:39,271 --> 00:22:40,940
This is the happiest day of my life.

606
00:22:41,024 --> 00:22:42,358
Always happy to be of service.

607
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:44,777
Oh, and, um, I got you something.

608
00:22:44,861 --> 00:22:46,445
Todd Chavez?

609
00:22:46,529 --> 00:22:48,239
Hey. That name's my name.

610
00:22:48,322 --> 00:22:49,699
What's "PB Livin'"?

611
00:22:49,782 --> 00:22:52,869
My film production
company. Read your title.

612
00:22:52,952 --> 00:22:57,331
"Executive Vice President
of West Coast Operations."

613
00:22:57,414 --> 00:23:00,417
Whoa! Does that mean I control the waves?

614
00:23:00,501 --> 00:23:02,294
No, it means you're my assistant.

615
00:23:02,378 --> 00:23:03,963
You've got a big future ahead of you,

616
00:23:04,047 --> 00:23:05,840
and I don't want you to
waste any time looking back.

617
00:23:05,923 --> 00:23:08,176
So I got all my cars' mirrors taken off.

618
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:09,927
Isn't that kind of dangerous?

619
00:23:10,011 --> 00:23:12,429
What do I care? I'm not driving.

620
00:23:12,513 --> 00:23:15,599
Hey, BoJack. Thanks for coming.

621
00:23:15,683 --> 00:23:17,101
I wasn't sure you were gonna make it.

622
00:23:17,185 --> 00:23:18,853
Wouldn't have missed it for the world.

623
00:23:18,936 --> 00:23:21,564
You're a good friend. I'm
really glad to know you.

624
00:23:21,647 --> 00:23:24,067
- Mwah.
- Sorry that I...

625
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,442
If I made things weird.

626
00:23:25,526 --> 00:23:27,237
They weren't that weird.

627
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:28,821
- Oh.
- Diane, honey?

628
00:23:28,905 --> 00:23:30,907
Oh, I gotta go dance with my husband.

629
00:23:32,324 --> 00:23:33,951
I'm married!

630
00:23:35,703 --> 00:23:37,329
Hi.

631
00:23:37,413 --> 00:23:40,166
So you're the quote-unquote
person, singular,

632
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,834
that everyone's so crazy about.

633
00:23:41,918 --> 00:23:43,460
What have you got figured out that I don't?

634
00:23:43,544 --> 00:23:46,256
Um, adult stuff.

635
00:23:46,338 --> 00:23:48,091
Yeah, I'm not seeing it.

636
00:23:48,174 --> 00:23:49,884
But that doesn't matter.
Not everything's about me.

637
00:23:49,967 --> 00:23:52,095
And maybe I am a little jealous.

638
00:23:52,178 --> 00:23:55,306
Not because I actually want to
date Princess Carolyn anymore,

639
00:23:55,431 --> 00:23:59,310
but just because I don't
like the idea that I can't.

640
00:23:59,393 --> 00:24:01,353
I guess I just assumed I always could.

641
00:24:01,437 --> 00:24:03,522
But I made a lot of bad decisions.

642
00:24:03,606 --> 00:24:06,150
Not just with her. With...

643
00:24:06,234 --> 00:24:08,652
with everyone, really.

644
00:24:08,736 --> 00:24:11,572
You know, Princess Carolyn was right.

645
00:24:11,655 --> 00:24:13,490
- You are a good listener.
- Thanks.

646
00:24:13,574 --> 00:24:15,952
You know, sometimes I feel
like I was born with a leak,

647
00:24:16,035 --> 00:24:18,579
and any goodness I started with just slowly

648
00:24:18,662 --> 00:24:20,581
spilled out of me, and now it's all gone.
