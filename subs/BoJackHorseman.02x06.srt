1
00:00:09,985 --> 00:00:13,821
As your accountant, I felt it
necessary to do this in person.

2
00:00:13,822 --> 00:00:16,574
Us, too. Because we're
really accounting on you...

3
00:00:16,575 --> 00:00:18,742
- No.
- to get in on the ground floor of this...

4
00:00:18,743 --> 00:00:20,453
No, don't do this. Please, God, no.

5
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:21,663
...PB Livin' product.

6
00:00:21,664 --> 00:00:23,998
Has this ever happened to you?

7
00:00:23,999 --> 00:00:27,210
Whatever it is, it hasn't happened.
Nothing has ever happened to me.

8
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:30,421
- You say you love a toasted bagel.
- I would never say that.

9
00:00:30,422 --> 00:00:33,734
- I have celiac disease.
- Ding. Bagel's ready.

10
00:00:33,758 --> 00:00:35,426
- But wait.
- Son of a...

11
00:00:35,427 --> 00:00:37,970
- Hey. That bagel was too fast.
- No.

12
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:41,432
That's why PB Livin'
presents, the Bagel Catcher.

13
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:44,602
- For all those hard-to-catch bagels.
- No, no. Stop. Enough. Enough.

14
00:00:44,603 --> 00:00:46,937
Stop talking! I can't take it anymore!

15
00:00:46,938 --> 00:00:48,939
PB Livin' is filing for bankruptcy.

16
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,151
- I'm shutting you down.
- I thought you were a customer.

17
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:53,695
I don't get what's happening.

18
00:00:53,696 --> 00:00:56,864
What's happening is you two
knuckleheads threw thousands of dollars

19
00:00:56,865 --> 00:00:58,700
into a bunch of dumb ideas.

20
00:00:58,701 --> 00:01:02,412
You paid 50 grand to a
bunch of kindergartners

21
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:04,788
for the movie rights to the game "tag."

22
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:07,083
Our business manager was
over the moon for that.

23
00:01:07,084 --> 00:01:09,793
Business manager? Who the
hell is your business manager?

24
00:01:09,794 --> 00:01:14,441
Business-wise, this all seems
like appropriate business.

25
00:01:14,466 --> 00:01:16,092
You two are done.

26
00:01:16,093 --> 00:01:20,346
This company is more in the
red than Carrie on prom night.

27
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:25,309
So, what you're saying is, we're just
one great idea away from breaking even?

28
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,771
No. You're... You are out of money.

29
00:01:27,772 --> 00:01:31,482
Mr. Peanutbutter, you need to get a job.

30
00:01:31,483 --> 00:01:34,919
- Are you hiring at your accounting firm?
- Dude, no.

31
00:01:39,157 --> 00:01:41,951
I'm waiting for my agent.
He'll be with me any moment.

32
00:01:41,952 --> 00:01:44,722
Mr. Peanutbutter is going back to work.

33
00:01:44,996 --> 00:01:48,874
Yeah. He's probably just organizing
all the amazing opportunities.

34
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:52,563
I haven't heard from him in years,
so they've probably been piling up.

35
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,649
Maybe I should just go check on him.

36
00:01:56,592 --> 00:02:00,261
Hello, Ronnie? It's your
favorite client, Mr. Peanutbutter.

37
00:02:00,262 --> 00:02:03,013
Well, I'm coming in. I hope
you're... Oh! Oh, my God.

38
00:02:03,014 --> 00:02:05,015
Ronnie, how'd you get
that belt around your neck,

39
00:02:05,016 --> 00:02:07,685
then caught on the filing cabinet,
which made your pants fall down

40
00:02:07,686 --> 00:02:11,748
while you were researching pornograph...
Oh, I see what happened here.

41
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,038
Morning time, Hollywoo.

42
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,334
- I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.
- And I'm Some Lady.

43
00:03:13,335 --> 00:03:14,960
Here's a thing written on a card.

44
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:19,357
Last night, major Hollywoo agent Ronnie
Bonito was found dead in his office...

45
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,382
Ruh-roh.

46
00:03:20,384 --> 00:03:23,969
...in what authorities are calling
a mishap of a sexual nature.

47
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,391
- What does that mean?
- You know, auto-erotic asphyxiation.

48
00:03:28,392 --> 00:03:30,226
Auto-a-what's it who's it?

49
00:03:30,227 --> 00:03:33,145
Oh, is that that thing
where you strangle yourself

50
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,857
in an attempt to
heighten sexual arousal?

51
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:37,668
It sure is.

52
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,531
Coming up, a food truck that
serves just one thing: gravy.

53
00:03:43,532 --> 00:03:45,199
Did you hear that? New food truck.

54
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,743
- We should go.
- I'm in.

55
00:03:46,744 --> 00:03:49,328
Hey, can I get some lunch
money? It's pizza day today.

56
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,622
Sure thing, sport. Wait,
where is it pizza day?

57
00:03:51,623 --> 00:03:53,332
- In my tummy.
- Oh...

58
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,419
Hey, BoJack, would you zip me
up? My shoulder is killing me.

59
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,714
I'm not sleeping right. We need
to do something about that bed.

60
00:03:59,715 --> 00:04:02,484
Just because I'm nocturnal doesn't
mean I wanna be up all night.

61
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,177
- I propped it up with a Golden Globe.
- It still wobbles.

62
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,346
- Yeah. Anyway, I got you something.
- Oh.

63
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,391
A beeper? BoJack, it's great,
but you know, I already have one.

64
00:04:10,392 --> 00:04:12,602
Yeah, you have a beeper, but I don't.

65
00:04:12,603 --> 00:04:15,145
Now, you can page me whenever you want.

66
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:18,942
Huh. BoJack, I love it, and
you're gonna love it, too.

67
00:04:18,943 --> 00:04:21,068
There's all kinds of codes
we can send each other.

68
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:22,986
"Zero, zero, zero" is "call me,"

69
00:04:22,987 --> 00:04:27,450
and "1-2-3" is "I miss you"
and "8-0-0-8-5" is boobs.

70
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:29,619
What? Boobs? Oh, my God.

71
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,346
What scamp came up with that one?

72
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,122
Okay, I gotta go. Dinner tonight?

73
00:04:33,123 --> 00:04:35,792
Totally. Let's hit that gravy truck.

74
00:04:35,793 --> 00:04:37,936
Okay, love you.

75
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,270
Uh...

76
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,939
Uh...

77
00:04:42,257 --> 00:04:43,901
No, I don't.

78
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:48,112
Aw... "I love you. No, I don't"?

79
00:04:49,514 --> 00:04:51,933
Uh... Keys.

80
00:04:51,934 --> 00:04:53,100
Uh-oh.

81
00:04:59,524 --> 00:05:01,043
Get out.

82
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:14,681
Hold it. Hold the elevator.

83
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,768
Ooh. Ah. Ee. Ow.

84
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:19,877
Goddam it. No. No. Ow.

85
00:05:19,878 --> 00:05:22,296
Oh. Ow. Oh...

86
00:05:22,297 --> 00:05:24,858
Coffee? Hup.

87
00:05:24,883 --> 00:05:27,510
Rutabaga, this day already sucks.

88
00:05:27,511 --> 00:05:29,929
My heel broke while I was
at this new food truck,

89
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,181
and I spilled a handful
of gravy all over myself

90
00:05:32,182 --> 00:05:35,392
because they don't
sell bowls, just gravy.

91
00:05:35,393 --> 00:05:38,521
Should've gone to the bowl truck
first. That's where they get you.

92
00:05:38,522 --> 00:05:41,190
Well, I guess the upside to
being invisible around here

93
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:44,568
is that none of these assholes
will ever notice what a mess I am.

94
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:47,196
Well, if it makes you feel any
better, I see what a mess you are.

95
00:05:47,197 --> 00:05:48,590
Aw...

96
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:50,574
Do you need the movie-star speech?

97
00:05:50,575 --> 00:05:53,786
No, no, I'll be okay. And how are you?

98
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,746
Gotta look at paint for the new kitchen.

99
00:05:55,747 --> 00:05:58,415
I have to pick a shade that won't
clash with the splatter of blood

100
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,960
from when I blow my brains
out after talking to Katie

101
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:04,106
about paint swatches all day.

102
00:06:04,214 --> 00:06:05,857
We do have fun.

103
00:06:10,054 --> 00:06:13,180
So, what's the plan for today?
Find a new agent, go on auditions?

104
00:06:13,181 --> 00:06:17,894
No, I'm gonna do exactly what landed me
Mr. Peanutbutter's House, oh, so long ago.

105
00:06:17,895 --> 00:06:20,063
Wander around L.A. with an open mind

106
00:06:20,064 --> 00:06:22,523
and an empty stomach
until I get discovered.

107
00:06:22,524 --> 00:06:25,359
But also, like, find a new
agent and go on auditions, right?

108
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,444
Or should I start
stealing food from work?

109
00:06:27,445 --> 00:06:30,823
I'm just gonna go with the flow
and leave everything up to destiny.

110
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:34,368
- Que sera quesadilla.
- You know we could lose the house, right?

111
00:06:34,369 --> 00:06:36,346
- Diane.
- Right?

112
00:06:36,371 --> 00:06:38,539
Diane, Diane, Diane.

113
00:06:48,717 --> 00:06:49,651
- Diane.
- Aah!

114
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:52,595
I wasn't stealing paper towels
to use as dinner napkins. Why?

115
00:06:52,596 --> 00:06:54,179
Here's a funny question for you:

116
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,640
If Mr. Peanutbutter said,
"I love you. No, I don't,"

117
00:06:56,641 --> 00:07:00,019
would you need to talk about that
later and figure out what he meant?

118
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,772
Probably not, right? Because
they're meaningless words?

119
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:04,440
I mean, language evolves, right?

120
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:06,358
How can anyone know what anything means?

121
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,694
The answer is nobody can.
Nothing means anything.

122
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,571
So why bother talking about anything?

123
00:07:10,572 --> 00:07:13,657
In this scenario, are Mr.
Peanutbutter and I living in our house?

124
00:07:13,658 --> 00:07:17,286
Or are we squatting in an abandoned
Barnes & Noble burning books to keep warm

125
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:19,789
as we struggle through our
Dickensian-style poverty?

126
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,706
Uh...

127
00:07:22,126 --> 00:07:24,543
"Zero, zero, zero." No
idea what that means.

128
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,087
I think it means "call me."

129
00:07:26,088 --> 00:07:28,422
Ignore. Wait, where's the ignore button?

130
00:07:28,423 --> 00:07:29,757
How do I ignore?

131
00:07:29,758 --> 00:07:32,318
I think with a beeper,
you just ignore it.

132
00:07:32,343 --> 00:07:35,387
- With what, my mind?
- You seem a little stressed out.

133
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,640
That's because as soon
as I'm done with work,

134
00:07:37,641 --> 00:07:39,725
I have to have a long,
awkward conversation

135
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:44,229
with Wanda about our relationship,
unless... I'm never done with work.

136
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,417
Diane, you magnificent
bastard. That's it.

137
00:07:53,448 --> 00:07:55,032
I'll be out there in the stands.

138
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:57,052
And I'll be rooting
for you, Secretariat.

139
00:07:57,368 --> 00:08:00,346
Mm. Yeah.

140
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,794
Your line is, "And I'll
see you at the finish line."

141
00:08:06,795 --> 00:08:10,756
Yeah, I know. I'm acting. Great.
Now I gotta start all over.

142
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:13,151
Settle in, folks. We
could be here a while.

143
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:19,015
- Ow! Ooh.
- Ah, Princess Carolyn.

144
00:08:19,016 --> 00:08:21,684
So good of you to join us eventually.

145
00:08:21,685 --> 00:08:24,020
Sorry I'm late. I had the worst morning.

146
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:26,480
You know who had an even
"the worst-er" morning?

147
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:29,566
- Ronnie Bonito. Because he's dead.
- He is?

148
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:31,902
He decided to strangle the dirty dangle

149
00:08:31,903 --> 00:08:35,656
and now that sweet chariot
has come for to carry him home.

150
00:08:35,657 --> 00:08:38,885
Everyone who was here on
time is taking a moment.

151
00:08:40,162 --> 00:08:41,954
- Of silence?
- Yes.

152
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:45,041
Also to reach out to his former clients.

153
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:47,710
- To offer their condolences?
- Yes.

154
00:08:47,711 --> 00:08:50,546
Also to recruit them
to the Vigor roster.

155
00:08:50,547 --> 00:08:53,966
- A Vigor agent is a vigorous agent.
- Who do you want me to call?

156
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:57,988
I have ins with a bunch of Bonito's
clients including all the major J's:

157
00:08:58,013 --> 00:09:02,058
- Law, Lo, Leno, and J. Abrams.
- Oh, that's wonderful news

158
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:05,435
in the parallel universe in
which you were on time today.

159
00:09:05,436 --> 00:09:08,355
In this reality,
however, we're all good.

160
00:09:08,356 --> 00:09:10,691
You can lap up the leftovers though.

161
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:13,402
- "Mr. Peanutbutter"?
- Oh, and Princess Carolyn?

162
00:09:13,403 --> 00:09:14,737
Get your shoe fixed.

163
00:09:14,738 --> 00:09:17,799
You look like a woman from
an '80s deodorant commercial.

164
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:28,101
Here I go. Destiny, don't fail me now.

165
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,546
Yeah. Hitting the pavement.

166
00:09:32,547 --> 00:09:35,025
This is how it happens
for a guy like me.

167
00:09:41,056 --> 00:09:43,574
Ew...

168
00:09:43,808 --> 00:09:45,869
Out of my way, flyer.

169
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:50,773
Ugh. Flyer. Why do you have to be
on my shoe in front of this store?

170
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:53,358
Wait, a second. Shoe.

171
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,069
Store.

172
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,714
Shoe store? Shoe store.

173
00:09:57,781 --> 00:09:59,406
"Team players wanted"?

174
00:09:59,407 --> 00:10:01,491
Oh, I'm such a good team player,

175
00:10:01,492 --> 00:10:04,595
I make all the other team
players look like garbage.

176
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:07,932
Lady Footlocker, meet your lord.

177
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:15,523
Finish...

178
00:10:17,467 --> 00:10:19,194
line.

179
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:22,221
Great, we got it. We got one take.

180
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,973
And now we gotta stop for the day.

181
00:10:23,974 --> 00:10:25,266
What? No. Why stop now?

182
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:29,019
- I'm just getting warmed up.
- Union rules. We're done. Go home.

183
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,271
Go home?

184
00:10:30,272 --> 00:10:34,233
Why go home when we could extend
this long day's journey into night?

185
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,902
- Drinks on me, folks.
- I could use a drink.

186
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:39,589
- Or six.
- Great, Corduroy's driving. Let's go.

187
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:43,260
Ah...

188
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:45,368
- I really needed this, BoJack.
- Me, too.

189
00:10:45,369 --> 00:10:47,621
Yeah, man. This day's
been really hard on me.

190
00:10:47,622 --> 00:10:50,874
Ever since I heard about that agent
who died from that blue-face blastoff?

191
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,876
- Blue-face blastoff?
- The strokey chokey?

192
00:10:52,877 --> 00:10:54,377
- The two-neck squeeze?
- What?

193
00:10:54,378 --> 00:10:56,672
You know, the one hand
on the Adam's apple,

194
00:10:56,673 --> 00:10:58,841
the other one's on the Adam's banana?

195
00:10:58,842 --> 00:11:02,112
Oh, right. Right.
Yeah. The auto-erotic...

196
00:11:02,137 --> 00:11:05,014
That could've been me. I used
to really be into that stuff.

197
00:11:05,015 --> 00:11:06,598
I was a hardcore gasper.

198
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,391
Can't believe you have
so many names for it.

199
00:11:08,392 --> 00:11:10,144
Now I can't stop thinking about it.

200
00:11:10,145 --> 00:11:12,395
I shouldn't even be alive right now.

201
00:11:12,396 --> 00:11:14,148
Don't need to talk
about how you masturbate.

202
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:16,441
- The orgasms you get...
- Okay, I guess we do.

203
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:19,236
It's like seeing a rainbow,
but with all the colors.

204
00:11:19,237 --> 00:11:21,947
- So, like a normal rainbow?
- But it's too dangerous, man.

205
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:25,159
They say if you bite down on a
lemon right at the point of climax,

206
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,578
the lemon juice gives you the jolt
you need to not pass out and die.

207
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:32,833
But still man, you're
just... rolling the dice.

208
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:35,002
Okay, this is getting really graphic.

209
00:11:35,003 --> 00:11:36,795
Can we maybe talk about anything else?

210
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,505
- Sure.
- Thank God.

211
00:11:38,506 --> 00:11:43,153
Hey, man, it's funny you should mention
God, because my new thing is... the Bible.

212
00:11:43,345 --> 00:11:44,261
Uh...

213
00:11:44,262 --> 00:11:48,598
Tell me, have you accepted Jesus
Christ as your Lord and personal savior?

214
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:51,894
So, noose-wise, what are we talking?
You use a standard sailor's knot

215
00:11:51,895 --> 00:11:53,913
or more like your average
birthday-present bow?

216
00:12:03,114 --> 00:12:05,782
- I beeped you, BoJack.
- Oh, hey. About this morning...

217
00:12:05,783 --> 00:12:07,784
- It's fine.
- Because when I said that...

218
00:12:07,785 --> 00:12:10,162
I said it's fine. You don't love me.

219
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,998
That's okay. I don't love you.

220
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:15,601
- What?
- Good night.

221
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:20,047
Morning time, Hollywoo.

222
00:12:20,048 --> 00:12:23,217
- I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.
- And I'm Some Lady.

223
00:12:23,218 --> 00:12:26,321
On today's show, I sit
down with Hank Hippopopalous

224
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:29,723
to discuss his new smash hit,
Hey, I Think You Can Dance.

225
00:12:29,724 --> 00:12:31,641
Can you talk about your process?

226
00:12:31,642 --> 00:12:33,894
When I see someone, and
I think they can dance,

227
00:12:33,895 --> 00:12:36,855
I say, "Hey, I think you can dance."

228
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:41,235
And when I think they can't dance, I
say, "No, I don't think you can dance."

229
00:12:41,236 --> 00:12:44,047
- And that is pretty much it.
- Fascinating.

230
00:12:44,989 --> 00:12:48,158
- So, last night when...
- BoJack, it's not a big deal.

231
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:50,077
You don't love me, I don't love you.

232
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:52,329
We're having a good time. It's fine.

233
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,497
Can't just say, "I don't
love you" to someone.

234
00:12:54,498 --> 00:12:56,917
- You said it to me.
- Yeah, but that was different.

235
00:12:56,918 --> 00:12:59,586
- How was that different?
- Because you do love me. Right?

236
00:12:59,587 --> 00:13:01,297
- Like a little bit?
- No.

237
00:13:01,298 --> 00:13:04,633
Uh, for what it's worth,
I love both you guys.

238
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:06,944
Shut up, Todd. Grown-ups are talking.

239
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,392
Here you go, ma'am.

240
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:19,106
Jessica Atkinson, come on down.

241
00:13:19,107 --> 00:13:20,417
Mr. Peanutbutter?

242
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:25,321
Would you like to see what's in
box number one or box number two?

243
00:13:25,322 --> 00:13:29,532
Either way, it's a
brand-new pair of shoes!

244
00:13:33,288 --> 00:13:34,847
Oh.

245
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:37,124
Hup. Carolyn.

246
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,501
- Rutabaga...
- Coffee?

247
00:13:38,502 --> 00:13:40,627
I was thinking about you last night

248
00:13:40,628 --> 00:13:44,423
while Katie and I were locked in a
fascinating debate about counter granite.

249
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:47,801
And what if I told you I used
to work Ronnie Bonito's desk,

250
00:13:47,802 --> 00:13:50,863
and I happen to know that
he had a client so hush-hush,

251
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:55,267
- it wasn't even on the master list.
- What? Who? Tell me. Whoa!

252
00:13:56,186 --> 00:14:00,689
Beloved novelist J.D. Salinger. What?

253
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,941
The author of Catcher in the Rye?

254
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:05,402
- And... others?
- Yuh-huh.

255
00:14:05,403 --> 00:14:07,821
- Isn't he dead?
- He's "reclusive."

256
00:14:07,822 --> 00:14:12,075
Dude wanted to be left alone
so much, he faked his own death.

257
00:14:12,076 --> 00:14:13,369
Oh, my God.

258
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,120
Why are you giving this lead to me?

259
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,747
- Because I like you, dummy.
- Huh.

260
00:14:17,748 --> 00:14:21,478
Now we gotta wait for the fire department
to come let us out of this elevator.

261
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:28,050
- Hey.
- Corduroy, what are you doing here?

262
00:14:28,051 --> 00:14:30,302
I need a favor. Can you
hold on to this for me?

263
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,780
- Ew. Is this your Bible?
- No, no, no.

264
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,848
- It's my choking-off kit.
- Your kit?

265
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:36,308
Yeah. It has all my supplies.

266
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:39,436
Silk ties, a leather
gag, velvet sock. Lemon.

267
00:14:39,437 --> 00:14:42,523
You gotta take this off my hands.
I can't trust myself with this.

268
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:44,649
I don't know if I want your
jack-off kit at my house.

269
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,860
Please. I got this
girlfriend. She loves me.

270
00:14:46,861 --> 00:14:50,155
If I fall back into the old
gasp-and-goo, it'll break her heart.

271
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,991
Wait. So, you're saying
if someone loves you,

272
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,702
they don't want you to choke
yourself while masturbating?

273
00:14:55,703 --> 00:14:57,681
Yeah. It's really dangerous.

274
00:14:57,705 --> 00:14:59,789
- All right. I'll take it.
- Thanks, BoJack.

275
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,875
I still don't understand
why you need a kit.

276
00:15:01,876 --> 00:15:03,936
Can't you just use,
like, a belt or a rope?

277
00:15:03,961 --> 00:15:05,921
Oh, I guess.

278
00:15:05,922 --> 00:15:07,839
I mean, I guess you could use anything.

279
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,028
I mean, you could use an iPhone charger,
a shoelace, a necktie, a jump-rope...

280
00:15:17,725 --> 00:15:19,494
Hm...

281
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,333
Oh. Ooh.

282
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:28,485
- Oh, hello. I'm looking for some...
- Sorry, no looking allowed.

283
00:15:28,486 --> 00:15:30,195
This store is for customers only.

284
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:33,823
Okay, then, I would like to buy a
bicycle. What would you recommend?

285
00:15:33,824 --> 00:15:35,951
- One with a bell, or...?
- You got me.

286
00:15:35,952 --> 00:15:40,163
I don't know anything about bicycles.
I'm J.D. Salinger. I faked my own death.

287
00:15:40,164 --> 00:15:44,960
Mr. Salinger. Such a pleasure.
Princess Carolyn, big fan.

288
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:46,962
Let me guess, Catcher in the Rye?

289
00:15:46,963 --> 00:15:48,797
And others.

290
00:15:48,798 --> 00:15:51,716
- I wanna say The Hobbi...
- Nope.

291
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,176
Look. I'm an agent.

292
00:15:53,177 --> 00:15:55,363
It doesn't matter whether
I've read your work.

293
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:59,475
What matters is I can look you in
the eye and tell you I'm a big fan.

294
00:15:59,476 --> 00:16:02,478
The world is ready for your
comeback, and I wanna help.

295
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:03,937
No, thank you. Not interested.

296
00:16:03,938 --> 00:16:05,814
Did that before, didn't work out well.

297
00:16:05,815 --> 00:16:07,983
Fans were relentless.
The critics were cruel.

298
00:16:07,984 --> 00:16:11,361
And that's why my motto is,
"It's better to be alone."

299
00:16:11,362 --> 00:16:13,071
Which, come to think of it,

300
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,740
is probably why I don't sell
a lot of tandem bicycles.

301
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,661
But, J.D. Salinger,
you are J.D. Salinger.

302
00:16:18,662 --> 00:16:20,764
You are a goddamn American treasure.

303
00:16:20,788 --> 00:16:24,374
But every time I go out in the
world, people hound me about my books.

304
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,042
Well, book.

305
00:16:26,043 --> 00:16:29,087
What if I told you there was a
place where no one reads books?

306
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,339
I'm listening.

307
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,509
A place where people only read
headlines, lists and pictures.

308
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,927
A place where people
hate reading so much,

309
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:39,616
they hire others to do it for them
and don't even pay a living wage.

310
00:16:39,641 --> 00:16:42,559
What do you mean, like,
modern reading slaves?

311
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,852
Exactly.

312
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:46,563
And all those modern reading
slaves really wanna be doing

313
00:16:46,564 --> 00:16:50,192
is writing things that, one day,
other people will also avoid reading.

314
00:16:50,193 --> 00:16:53,820
- Does such a place truly exist?
- Come with me, J.D. Salinger.

315
00:16:53,821 --> 00:16:55,715
Let's go to Hollywoo.

316
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,264
Hup!

317
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,602
Oh...

318
00:17:07,711 --> 00:17:09,002
- Hey.
- Hey.

319
00:17:09,003 --> 00:17:10,753
- We need to talk.
- Okay.

320
00:17:10,754 --> 00:17:13,923
You're probably wondering what
this beautiful mahogany box is.

321
00:17:13,924 --> 00:17:17,344
- I wasn't wondering that.
- It's my auto-erotic asphyxiation kit.

322
00:17:17,345 --> 00:17:19,823
I've decided to do
the funky Spider-Man.

323
00:17:19,847 --> 00:17:22,641
- What? Funky Spider-Man?
- I came up with that one myself.

324
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:24,560
Because he hangs,
then he shoots webbing.

325
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:28,355
Wait. Are you saying you want to
auto-erotic asphyxiate yourself?

326
00:17:28,356 --> 00:17:29,690
Yes. I do.

327
00:17:29,691 --> 00:17:31,316
Even though it's very dangerous

328
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,002
- and I could die.
- Oh.

329
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:36,279
Now, if you love me, you probably
wouldn't want me to do it.

330
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,575
- Okay. I get it.
- Since you don't, I should do it, right?

331
00:17:39,576 --> 00:17:42,578
I mean, there's no reason
not to... unless you love me.

332
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:44,120
- Do it.
- Wait. Seriously?

333
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:45,872
Seems like you've
already made up your mind.

334
00:17:45,873 --> 00:17:48,041
If you're that set on
it, knock yourself out.

335
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:50,753
Only if I do it wrong.

336
00:17:50,754 --> 00:17:53,463
Because as I mentioned
before, it's very dangerous.

337
00:17:53,464 --> 00:17:55,882
- Have fun.
- I'm serious. I'm really gonna do it.

338
00:17:55,883 --> 00:17:59,278
Great. Put a towel down.
Not one of the good ones.

339
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,639
Morning time, Hollywoo.

340
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,474
I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.

341
00:18:04,475 --> 00:18:07,911
And I'm An Actress Or Something, I
don't know, sitting in for Some Lady.

342
00:18:07,937 --> 00:18:10,606
- Whoa. What happened to her?
- She got kidnapped.

343
00:18:10,607 --> 00:18:12,124
Oh, boy.

344
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:15,527
Oh, my. Ooh, wow.

345
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:18,821
Oh, hey. Look who survived
to masturbate another day.

346
00:18:18,822 --> 00:18:20,699
Well, I didn't do it yet, obviously.

347
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,618
If I'm gonna do it,
I'm gonna go all out.

348
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:25,662
A big job like that needs lumber,
and pulleys, lemons, so forth.

349
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:29,082
I'm not gonna half-ass anything.
This is my orgasm we're talking about.

350
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,376
Okay. Well, I wish you all the best.

351
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:33,754
- Not too late to stop me.
- I'm not gonna stop you.

352
00:18:33,755 --> 00:18:36,005
- Good 'cause don't.
- All right, we're in agreement.

353
00:18:36,006 --> 00:18:37,507
Stop fighting!

354
00:18:37,508 --> 00:18:39,676
Can't you two see what
this is doing to me?

355
00:18:39,677 --> 00:18:42,154
I've been acting out.

356
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,574
Have a great day.

357
00:18:44,848 --> 00:18:46,308
Todd? Get in the car.

358
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:49,269
It's time to get serious
about auto-erotic asphyxiation.

359
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,665
Hooray! Question mark?

360
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:59,529
Just play it cool, Todd. No one
needs to know why we're here.

361
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:02,907
Excuse me, I'm looking for something
that will hold up a lot of weight.

362
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:06,829
Let's say something that could hoist
up a horse comfortably by the neck.

363
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,289
Not for suicide purposes.

364
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,101
I'm trying to have a
more fulfilling orgasm.

365
00:19:15,045 --> 00:19:18,841
The world wept when news
broke that J.D. Salinger died.

366
00:19:18,842 --> 00:19:22,820
- J.D. Salinger died?
- But I'm here to tell you, he didn't die.

367
00:19:22,886 --> 00:19:24,739
J.D. Salinger didn't die?

368
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,808
As one of the 20th century's
most celebrated authors,

369
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:30,853
J.D. Salinger has inspired
countless dreamers,

370
00:19:30,854 --> 00:19:33,146
eighth graders and
occasionally, assassins.

371
00:19:33,147 --> 00:19:36,274
His spare lyricism and
devotion to character

372
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:40,069
will undoubtedly translate into a
penetrating dramatic work for this,

373
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,322
the golden age of television writing.

374
00:19:42,323 --> 00:19:44,199
J.D. Take it away.

375
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,662
I wanna do a show where people
ask celebrities trivia questions.

376
00:19:48,663 --> 00:19:50,246
- What?
- Like a game show?

377
00:19:50,247 --> 00:19:52,666
Yeah. You know because
since they're famous people,

378
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:55,960
I think normal people would wanna
see if they know trivia and stuff.

379
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:59,798
You know, like, Hollywoo stars
and celebrities, what do they know?

380
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,966
Do they know things? Let's find out.

381
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:05,637
What a hoot. I love it, and I don't
use that word with just anybody.

382
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:06,656
What do you call it?

383
00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:10,141
I call it Hollywoo Stars
and What Do They Know?

384
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,394
Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out.

385
00:20:12,395 --> 00:20:14,187
It's maybe more of a working title.

386
00:20:14,188 --> 00:20:16,064
I can see it on the marquee already.

387
00:20:16,065 --> 00:20:17,900
- Must be a long marquee.
- It's long.

388
00:20:17,901 --> 00:20:20,861
Yeah, yeah. The celebrities
can also do physical challenges.

389
00:20:20,862 --> 00:20:21,778
Oh, it's perfect.

390
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:25,073
We've been searching for a companion
for Hey, I Think You Can Dance.

391
00:20:25,074 --> 00:20:27,551
But wait, wait one
second. Who's gonna host?

392
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:30,579
Huh. I've got the perfect guy.

393
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,891
Who wants to be in Nike Airs?

394
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,669
Claire, you are looking off the
charts "gorge" in those tennis shoes.

395
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:41,524
Would you like to buy a towel?

396
00:20:41,758 --> 00:20:44,342
Because I'm throwing one in for free.

397
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,302
- He's perfect.
- Mm-hm.

398
00:20:46,303 --> 00:20:47,763
Mr. Peanutbutter?

399
00:20:47,764 --> 00:20:52,869
How would you like to be the host of
J.D. Salinger's new celebrity game show?

400
00:20:52,894 --> 00:20:56,229
What? I knew destiny had a plan for me.

401
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,147
You know, it just goes to show,

402
00:20:58,148 --> 00:21:00,943
with the right attitude,
every single one of your dreams

403
00:21:00,944 --> 00:21:02,569
will always come true.

404
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,279
And if your dreams don't come true,

405
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,175
it's probably because you just
didn't have the right attitude.

406
00:21:10,494 --> 00:21:15,039
Today, one agent did something
that no one else could.

407
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,061
I'll give you two
hints: catcher and rye.

408
00:21:18,085 --> 00:21:20,002
Oh. Nothing. It's nothing.

409
00:21:20,003 --> 00:21:24,173
Charley Witherspoon caught a rye
bagel coming out of the toaster.

410
00:21:24,174 --> 00:21:27,218
- Come again?
- It was coming fast and hot.

411
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,990
One day, some genius will
invent some sort of bagel catcher

412
00:21:31,014 --> 00:21:33,057
that takes the guesswork
out of this task,

413
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:36,311
but until then, Charley
gets a gold star.

414
00:21:36,312 --> 00:21:40,708
- Thanks, Dad. I mean, Mr. Dad.
- Oh...

415
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:46,154
Oh, boy.

416
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:47,990
Hey. Wasn't sure if I'd see you.

417
00:21:47,991 --> 00:21:51,576
Still alive? Because auto-erotic
asphyxiation is so risky?

418
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:53,244
Well, here I am, for now.

419
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,956
BoJack... Wait. Did you fix the bed?

420
00:21:55,957 --> 00:21:57,624
Yeah. I was at the hardware store

421
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:01,043
picking up supplies for my
auto-erotic asphyxiation machine.

422
00:22:01,044 --> 00:22:02,378
Because, as you are aware,

423
00:22:02,379 --> 00:22:05,632
I'm preparing to auto-erotic
asphyxiate myself.

424
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:09,636
Figured I'd get stuff for the bed so you
could at least get a good night's sleep.

425
00:22:09,637 --> 00:22:11,554
Okay, BoJack.

426
00:22:11,555 --> 00:22:13,657
Wanna talk about the
elephant in the room?

427
00:22:13,724 --> 00:22:17,059
Wow. Okay. You know what?

428
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,729
You know what? Here's... First of all...

429
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:24,108
Wow. All right, I can't even...

430
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,862
You know what? I...

431
00:22:26,863 --> 00:22:27,797
Wow.

432
00:22:27,905 --> 00:22:29,698
He is never gonna forget that.

433
00:22:29,699 --> 00:22:30,949
What is this all about?

434
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,886
This isn't about anything but
the pursuit of the kind of orgasm

435
00:22:33,911 --> 00:22:36,162
that feels like a
rainbow with every color.

436
00:22:36,163 --> 00:22:37,831
- So, a regular rainbow.
- No.

437
00:22:37,832 --> 00:22:40,750
So, if you don't mind, as
long as you don't love me,

438
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:43,169
I have a noose to step into.

439
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,129
I just need to release this lever,

440
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,632
drop these bags of sand,
which act as counterweights,

441
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:50,134
and then just pull this nozzle.

442
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,721
- Perfect.
- Okay. Have fun.

443
00:22:52,722 --> 00:22:56,993
- Wait, Wanda.
- Okay, fine, you stupid baby.

444
00:22:57,018 --> 00:22:58,368
I love you.

445
00:22:58,936 --> 00:23:01,771
I... I knew it.

446
00:23:01,772 --> 00:23:05,292
But I'm not going to tell you
not to do the funky Spider-Man.

447
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:08,319
- What?
- You need to be responsible for yourself.

448
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,196
- That doesn't sound like me.
- I know.

449
00:23:10,197 --> 00:23:13,199
But if you love me,
too, you won't do it.

450
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:19,081
- I thought so.
- Okay.

451
00:23:19,082 --> 00:23:22,542
Just for the record, I never really
wanted to do this in the first place,

452
00:23:22,543 --> 00:23:24,711
Me not doing it is not
a sign that I love you.

453
00:23:24,712 --> 00:23:26,963
- It's just because I'm a coward.
- Okay.

454
00:23:26,964 --> 00:23:28,673
- I don't love you.
- Sure, you don't.

455
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:31,217
I don't. Come back
here. I don't love you.

456
00:23:31,218 --> 00:23:33,362
You don't make me feel less broken.

457
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:37,974
I don't get it.

458
00:23:37,975 --> 00:23:42,603
I singlehandedly got a Lady Footlocker
store employee a primetime show

459
00:23:42,605 --> 00:23:47,025
and resurrected a certified
dead man and nobody cared.

460
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:49,837
- Why do I do anything?
- Hey.

461
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,048
Do you need the movie star speech?

462
00:23:52,155 --> 00:23:54,032
Yeah.

463
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:57,744
Okay. Carolyn, you are
the star of a movie.

464
00:23:57,745 --> 00:24:00,747
This is the part of the movie
where you get your heart broken.

465
00:24:00,748 --> 00:24:03,708
Where the world tests you,
and people treat you like shit.

466
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:05,376
But it has to happen this way.

467
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,962
Otherwise, the end of the movie,

468
00:24:06,963 --> 00:24:10,172
when you get everything you
want, won't feel as rewarding.

469
00:24:10,173 --> 00:24:14,218
There are assholes out there,
but in the end, they don't matter.

470
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,512
Because this movie's not about them.

471
00:24:16,513 --> 00:24:18,140
It's never been about them.

472
00:24:18,141 --> 00:24:21,869
All this time, the
movie's been about you.

473
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:23,204
Thanks.

474
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,565
- Carolyn?
- Yes, Rutabaga?

475
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:30,961
I think Katie and I
are getting a divorce.

476
00:24:31,988 --> 00:24:34,697
Corduroy? I don't want
this thing anymore.

477
00:24:34,698 --> 00:24:36,449
Corduroy?

478
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,742
Hey, you decent, man?

479
00:24:39,703 --> 00:24:41,430
Oh, sweet Jesus.

480
00:24:41,692 --> 00:24:47,293
