1
00:00:00,949 --> 00:00:02,996
You got to get your shit together.

2
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:06,589
So you took some licks, but
you're gonna bounce back,

3
00:00:06,672 --> 00:00:08,674
because you're talented, you're smart,

4
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:10,384
and damn it, you're good.

5
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:12,845
You are a goddamn American
treasure, you know that?

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,641
You are BoJack goddamn Horseman.

7
00:00:16,724 --> 00:00:18,350
So get the hell off my lawn.

8
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:20,061
Oh.

9
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,855
Here I thought I was at the
drive-through at Carl's Jr.

10
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,690
How much did I have to drink last night?

11
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,985
Last night? Oh, you've been on a bender

12
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,070
for the last two weeks, ever
since you found out Diane

13
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,362
got engaged to Mr. Peanutbutter.

14
00:00:30,446 --> 00:00:32,448
Diane got engaged to Mr. Peanutbutter?

15
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:34,700
- I need a drink.
- No. No more drinking.

16
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:36,786
You've been out of control.

17
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:39,998
Princess Carolyn, look. I met John Stamos.

18
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,791
That is not John Stamos.

19
00:00:41,874 --> 00:00:43,209
Hey, Princess Carolyn,

20
00:00:43,292 --> 00:00:45,753
John Stamos and I got our ears pierced.

21
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,130
That is not your ear.

22
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,633
Princess Carolyn, John Stamos died.

23
00:00:50,716 --> 00:00:53,011
Why? Why, God?

24
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:55,429
Why did you take John Stamos?

25
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:57,264
That doesn't sound so bad.

26
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,558
Oh, I forgot to mention you
were naked for a lot of that.

27
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:03,188
Stamos!

28
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,857
Also, it wasn't here. It was at my office.

29
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,942
We thought night swimming would be fun,

30
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,903
but the current was too strong.

31
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,905
Oh, God, I wasn't driving around, was I?

32
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:15,074
No. You made Todd your designated driver,

33
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,202
but then you also made him drink with you.

34
00:01:17,284 --> 00:01:20,621
Yeah, I'll have a western
bacon cheeseburger.

35
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,999
BoJack, we are going to
get you back on your feet.

36
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:25,001
All you need to do is get off Diane

37
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,418
and get on to something else.

38
00:01:26,502 --> 00:01:27,879
Hello?

39
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,421
Tony, hi. I'm calling in that favor.

40
00:01:29,505 --> 00:01:31,174
Get your crew to BoJack Horseman's house.

41
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,800
Can you be there in an hour?

42
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,219
- Yeah.
- Great.

43
00:01:34,301 --> 00:01:35,678
What just happened?

44
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:37,346
You're the new face of Guten Bourbon.

45
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:38,681
What is Guten Bourbon?

46
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:39,765
It's an urban German bourbon.

47
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,393
Am I just hungover, or are
you talking like a Muppet?

48
00:01:42,476 --> 00:01:44,187
They're looking for American celebrities

49
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,813
to talk about how much they like to drink.

50
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,565
It's the part you were born to play.

51
00:01:47,648 --> 00:01:50,401
All you have to do is
smile and stay upright.

52
00:01:50,484 --> 00:01:52,444
I don't know. It sounds like a lot of work.

53
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:54,947
You take up 80% of my time with your drama

54
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,866
and make me 0% of my money.

55
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:58,284
Do the damn commercial.

56
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:02,454
7:00 A.M. Breakfast with Lenny Turteltaub.

57
00:02:02,538 --> 00:02:04,999
Okay, I got to go. You're in charge, Todd.

58
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,001
Keep this dummy out of trouble.

59
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,460
Hooray, responsibility.

60
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:10,255
Hey.

61
00:02:10,337 --> 00:02:13,258
Do you really believe all that
stuff you said to me earlier

62
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,135
about me being smart and talented and good?

63
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:20,681
BoJack, I'm an agent. I
believe everything I say.

64
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,183
Ah.

65
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,685
Hey, where the hell is that cheeseburger?

66
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,395
I ordered it, like, an hour ago.

67
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,652
Synced and Corrected by Nsiko
www.Addic7ed.com

68
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,578
Lenny Turteltaub, you skinny bitch.

69
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,122
How the hell are you?

70
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:29,834
I'm in a hurry, so I'll
make this... snappy.

71
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:31,210
I got some great news about the picture

72
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,295
we're putting together.

73
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,755
Sorry. Hello?

74
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,967
Hey, I just wanted to thank
you for getting me this job

75
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,595
and pulling me out of that
oh-so-predictably BoJack

76
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,181
spiral of self-loathing
and substance abuse.

77
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,766
- You really are the best.
- I know. Talk to you later.

78
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,560
I feel like you see things
in me that nobody else sees.

79
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:50,062
Yep, I'm pretty great. Got to go.

80
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,772
All this time, I never even...

81
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,440
BoJack, I'm in a very
important breakfast right now.

82
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,360
- Okay. I got to go, too.
- Sorry.

83
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:56,694
What's the great news?

84
00:03:56,777 --> 00:04:00,156
- We got Braff.
- You beautiful dickhead.

85
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,158
You finally got Zach Braff?

86
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:04,660
Ah, no other director has enough weight

87
00:04:04,743 --> 00:04:07,246
to handle a movie about
the last days of Eva Braun.

88
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,373
No shit, toots.

89
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:11,083
Ooh, ooh, ooh. There you go.

90
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,377
Thank you, sweetheart.

91
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:13,544
Everything's coming together.

92
00:04:13,627 --> 00:04:14,920
With Braff directing,

93
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,214
my client Cate Blanchett starring,

94
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:18,674
and the great Lenny Turteltaub producing,

95
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:20,551
this movie is a done deal.

96
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:22,387
Look, honey, I been in this
business a long time, okay?

97
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:23,888
Long time.

98
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:26,432
And as I once said to
a young Ed Begley Sr.,

99
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,767
"It ain't a done deal till
the deals are all done."

100
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,395
I'm the best agent in the biz.

101
00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:33,439
I can seal these deals
with my paws in my pants.

102
00:04:33,522 --> 00:04:35,066
Well, then I'll say to you what I once said

103
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,902
to a young Buster Keaton, "What?"

104
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,831
Laura! What's happening?

105
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,833
- We're merging.
- No shit. With what?

106
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,668
FME. A bunch of people got laid off,

107
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,879
and some of the FMEERS
are already moving in.

108
00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:58,797
It's all so sudden and unexpected.

109
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:02,718
It was not handled well.

110
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:05,179
Oh, shit. Don't tell me
one of the new agents is...

111
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,680
Vanessa Gekko.

112
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:10,017
That slippery, slimy,
cold-blooded, bug-eyed...

113
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,436
What's new, pussycat?

114
00:05:11,518 --> 00:05:13,312
- Gekko.
- In the flesh.

115
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,522
Ha ha. How are you?

116
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,358
What a morning, huh?

117
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,693
I was in the middle of
my second soul cycle class

118
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:20,819
when I got the news.

119
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,529
- Can you imagine?
- No.

120
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,907
I was so excited, I rushed home,

121
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,118
made love to my husband of 15 years,

122
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,370
made a hot breakfast for
my three wonderful girls,

123
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,123
read to them, dropped them off
at their elite private school,

124
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,250
and then got my ass
here as quick as I could.

125
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,295
- Um, how old are your kids now?
- I don't have any children.

126
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:40,172
Oh, well, it'll happen. You're still...

127
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,634
- Anyway...
- Princess Carolyn.

128
00:05:43,717 --> 00:05:47,679
I see you've already met
a new member of the team.

129
00:05:47,763 --> 00:05:50,099
- Vanessa Gekko, sir.
- I know that.

130
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:52,226
This merger is very exciting.

131
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,019
- I'm pumped.
- I'm beyond pumped.

132
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,563
You should be, or at least
I think you should be.

133
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,233
It's hard to keep track
of who's getting promoted

134
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,319
- and who's getting fired.
- Oh.

135
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,863
You're probably fine or not. Who knows?

136
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,409
Ugh. What do you want, Todd?

137
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,453
Well, good news, bad news.

138
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,664
The bad news is that there
actually is no good news,

139
00:06:13,747 --> 00:06:16,375
and the other bad news is BoJack's gone.

140
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,044
What? Where did he go?
The shoot is at his house.

141
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,672
He just disappeared. I don't
even know why he'd leave.

142
00:06:21,755 --> 00:06:23,924
This charcoal mellowed
bourbon is so smooth,

143
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:27,261
every time I take a sip, pure happiness.

144
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,054
- That was amazing.
- Really?

145
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,848
Can I get you to say that in a tuxedo?

146
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:32,766
Hey, I got to go. I think
this is my big break.

147
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,144
Don't worry. I won't let it
get to my head or anything.

148
00:06:35,227 --> 00:06:39,023
Hey, who told that asshole
he could sit in my chair?

149
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:41,484
Don't forget I'm your
agent, too! I want 10%.

150
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,818
Hello, beautiful.

151
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:44,403
What the hell are you doing here?

152
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,155
You're supposed to be
shooting a commercial.

153
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:48,199
I know, but I was sitting
there drinking bourbon and...

154
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,950
They didn't give you fake bourbon on set?

155
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,702
Oh, they did, and then I
just mixed it with bourbon.

156
00:06:51,785 --> 00:06:53,245
And it hit me.

157
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,164
Why was I so upset about
Diane getting engaged?

158
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:57,542
You're the one who's
always been there for me,

159
00:06:57,624 --> 00:06:59,043
so I drank a lot more bourbon

160
00:06:59,126 --> 00:07:01,086
and drove over to tell you how I feel.

161
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,754
Oh, I see what this is.

162
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:05,174
Princess Carolyn, what are we doing?

163
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:07,301
Clearly we're in love with each other.

164
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,303
You're not in love with me.
You're in love with Diane.

165
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,222
And you're not even
really in love with her.

166
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,764
You just think you are because you pay her

167
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:14,266
to listen to you talk about yourself.

168
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,767
Diane getting engaged was the best thing

169
00:07:15,851 --> 00:07:17,019
that ever happened to me.

170
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:19,688
It made me realize you're
the one I need to be with.

171
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:23,275
Ha! You say that every
time something bad happens.

172
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,985
Not getting nominated for
a People's Choice Award

173
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,737
is the best thing that ever happened to me.

174
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,239
It made me realize...

175
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,907
Getting caught with that pound of cocaine

176
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,742
was the best thing that
ever happened to me.

177
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:33,244
That hooker getting pregnant

178
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,537
was the best thing that
ever happened to me.

179
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,414
Sneezing on Marisa Tomei was the best...

180
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,874
Every time something bad happens,

181
00:07:38,957 --> 00:07:40,918
you come running to me for comfort.

182
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:42,794
Well, it's not gonna happen this time.

183
00:07:42,878 --> 00:07:45,005
I can't be your agent and your girlfriend.

184
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,757
It just doesn't work.

185
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,634
I have Lenny Turteltaub for you.

186
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:50,094
- I have to take this.
- Okay.

187
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:52,638
But remember, I'm coming for you,

188
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:55,266
and I'm gonna make you love me.

189
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,184
Please don't. Hey.

190
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,477
Bad news, P.C.

191
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,771
Braff used your merger as
an opportunity to jump ship.

192
00:08:00,854 --> 00:08:01,939
Aw, fish.

193
00:08:02,022 --> 00:08:04,358
Now his new agent's
asking for twice the money.

194
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,611
As I once said to a young Lionel Barrymore,

195
00:08:06,693 --> 00:08:08,695
"Eh, shut up."

196
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,865
Without a director, Eva
Braun is as dead as Eva Braun.

197
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,200
Yep. You got to get someone big.

198
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,786
- What about those brothers...
- Hello? Hello?

199
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:17,329
Lady, you work too hard.

200
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,373
That was an important phone call.

201
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,500
Important phone call beep boop blorp.

202
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,085
Don't you robot-voice me.

203
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:25,588
Princess Carolyn, what are we doing?

204
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,965
Well, I'm working, and you are leaving.

205
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:30,342
Before I go, I got you
a little sexy something

206
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,885
to remember me by.

207
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,887
Since we can't be together every second,

208
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:37,182
which would be my preference,
I give you cardboard BoJack.

209
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,725
It's got a light-sensitive sound chip,

210
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,018
so every time you walk by it,

211
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,395
it quotes a line from Jerry Maguire,

212
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,647
your favorite movie.

213
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:43,981
You complete me.

214
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:45,274
What do you think? Pretty sweet, huh?

215
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:46,900
You had me at "hello."

216
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,069
I don't have time for you or cardboard you.

217
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,404
I need to find a new director.

218
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,491
Or you could find my nude erector...

219
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,617
She's gone.

220
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,206
Blech. Word to the wise, Laura...

221
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,001
Do not pitch a Nazi
romance to Steven Spielberg.

222
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:05,503
Just thought you should know

223
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,878
there's been some reorganization

224
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:08,880
- vis-a-vis resource management.
- What are you saying?

225
00:09:08,964 --> 00:09:10,716
You and Vanessa Gekko are sharing an office

226
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,468
until they can find her a permanent one.

227
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:14,386
- The hell we are.
- Also...

228
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,930
Good news, Princess Carolyn.
Vanessa's my agent now.

229
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,056
What?

230
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,017
You said you couldn't be
my girlfriend and my agent,

231
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,686
so I'm firing you.

232
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:23,312
Now we can be in love.

233
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:26,231
- Hope you like money, BoJack.
- This is so great.

234
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:29,067
Now I can date you and have a better agent.

235
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,653
- Everybody wins.
- Oh.

236
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,070
I'm a sporting agent.

237
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:35,366
Are you still searching for happiness?

238
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,826
Make your own happiness.

239
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:41,330
Mmm, that's some Guten Bourbon.

240
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:42,998
Cut. That was great.

241
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:45,417
Was it? You know, I'm
trying to do good work here,

242
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:48,379
really find the character,
but it's pretty distracting

243
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,880
to have all these robots

244
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:52,049
staring at me with their blinking red eyes.

245
00:09:52,132 --> 00:09:54,885
Those are cameras, Todd.
We're making a commercial.

246
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:56,762
Oh, well, you want to make a good one?

247
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:58,805
Then get them the hell out of here!

248
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,393
I'm the face of this brand,
I'm the man behind the thing,

249
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,395
and I'm determined to get the jargon

250
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:08,440
of this German bourbon blurbin'.

251
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,900
Is it just me, or does this fake booze

252
00:10:09,983 --> 00:10:11,777
taste a lot like real booze?

253
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:14,613
You want BoJack, you can have him.

254
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,699
Here's a list of directors
who won't work with him,

255
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,325
studios that won't hire him,

256
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,493
former assistants with restraining orders.

257
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,911
This is great.

258
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:22,371
You know, it gets kind of boring

259
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:24,415
when all your clients are in such demand,

260
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,250
they practically find their own jobs.

261
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,794
Well, then BoJack should
be a lot of fun for you.

262
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:31,171
No one wants to hire him.

263
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:34,800
Hello. We're looking for
BoJack Horseman's agent.

264
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:36,468
We'd like to discuss

265
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,012
a very lucrative business opportunity.

266
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,265
- You gotta be kidding me.
- I'm BoJack's agent.

267
00:10:41,348 --> 00:10:44,393
The opportunity is we're blackmailing you.

268
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:46,144
Ha. All yours.

269
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,730
Needless to say,

270
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,274
it would be a shame if
these pictures got out.

271
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:52,651
Fortunately, that can easily be avoided

272
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:58,657
by simply paying me and
my partner here $150.

273
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,950
Each.

274
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:01,159
Let me just get my checkbook.

275
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,244
Huh?

276
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:03,788
Whoa.

277
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,457
Oh, except California law
prohibits taking photos

278
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,375
on private property without a permit,

279
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,460
but you had a permit, right?

280
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,211
- Uh...
- What's that?

281
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,504
Oh, also, extortion can be prosecuted

282
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,672
as a class E felony.

283
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,466
That's four years in prison, easy,

284
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,426
and when you throw in the
murder of Tupac Shakur...

285
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:18,552
- We didn't do that.
- Yeah, yeah.

286
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,053
You can't pin that on us.

287
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,597
Well, someone's got to take the fall.

288
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,890
Sorry to bother you.

289
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,017
Forget we were ever here.

290
00:11:29,104 --> 00:11:30,856
That was fun.

291
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:32,858
Hey, Laura, send those guys
a nice fruit-and-nut basket.

292
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:34,276
You got it, boss.

293
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:35,902
Who said you could use my assistant?

294
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,781
- I did.
- Oh, hello, Mr. Witherspoon.

295
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,449
Did you know the human
head weighs 8 pounds?

296
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:41,826
Fascinating.

297
00:11:41,908 --> 00:11:44,453
So sorry we have to double up on everything

298
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:47,456
while we work out who goes
where and who gets fired,

299
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:50,835
but in the meantime, help
yourself to an intern,

300
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:53,712
one of the rising stars at our company...

301
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:57,591
- Charlie Witherspoon.
- Hello. I... Oh.

302
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,886
Sorry, my... My hands are really sticky.

303
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:05,766
Oh, God, am I blowing this?

304
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,228
Charlie was the editor
of The Harvard Lampoon.

305
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,772
He can be Princess Carolyn's new assistant

306
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:12,981
while I use Laura.

307
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:14,107
- Ugh.
- Good thinking, boss.

308
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,236
Ah, ah, phone is ringing. Phone is ringing.

309
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,864
What do I do? What do I do?

310
00:12:19,946 --> 00:12:22,574
I'll take it in here, Charlie. Hello.

311
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,035
Princess Carolyn, your
client is out of control.

312
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:27,120
BoJack is not my client anymore.

313
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,747
Not BoJack. Todd.

314
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,500
I think someone mixed
alcohol into his prop drink.

315
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,043
Oh, you pretenders.

316
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:34,961
Bourbon is the name of a county.

317
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,798
You can't just make bourbon in Germany.

318
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,842
That would be like
making Rice-A-Roni

319
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,720
- anywhere but San Francisco.
- No, no, no, no, no.

320
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,806
- Ugh. I'll be right there.
- Ow.

321
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,516
You got to get your shit together.

322
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:50,352
You are a winner, okay?
You are Todd... Hold on.

323
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:54,231
4:30 P.M. Meeting with Eva Braun team.

324
00:12:54,314 --> 00:12:57,693
Fish. Okay, you are Todd goddamn...

325
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,695
- What's your last name?
- Chavez.

326
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,572
- Your last name is Chavez?
- Yeah. Why?

327
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,073
I don't know, I just never thought of you

328
00:13:03,156 --> 00:13:04,742
as a Chavez. Look, I got to go.

329
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,535
I feel like you didn't
really finish the pep talk.

330
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:08,119
I know, but I got a movie to put together.

331
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:09,246
Best of luck.

332
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,249
Ready for the tagline? Here's the tagline.

333
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:13,333
What the heck is going on?

334
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,294
"The woman who loved the
man who hated everyone."

335
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,422
- That writes itself.
- You got to be kidding me.

336
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:22,050
Hey, where were you? We looked everywhere.

337
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:24,261
You're having the Eva
Braun meeting without me?

338
00:13:24,344 --> 00:13:26,054
I'm so sorry,

339
00:13:26,137 --> 00:13:28,181
but I didn't know what the
protocol was around here,

340
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,141
and these guys were
just champing at the bit.

341
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:32,185
- We're just wrapping up.
- But Cate is my client.

342
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,145
Okay, why don't I come
find you when it's over,

343
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:35,773
and I'll bring you up to speed?

344
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,858
Is that Quentin Tarantulino?

345
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,735
Yeah. I brought him on board.

346
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,904
You know he's always wanted
to direct a romantic comedy?

347
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,155
Eva Braun is not a romantic comedy.

348
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:45,574
Bye.

349
00:13:48,076 --> 00:13:51,830
We live in a cynical
world, a cynical world.

350
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,082
He's right, you know.

351
00:13:54,165 --> 00:13:57,335
Oh, ooh, oh, oh, over-rotate. Hey.

352
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,004
I just missed an important meeting

353
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:01,465
because I was babysitting
Todd, who's too drunk to work,

354
00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:03,592
because you switched out the prop bourbon

355
00:14:03,675 --> 00:14:06,386
with the real bourbon.
You are ruining my life.

356
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,639
- Have dinner with me tonight.
- No way.

357
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:12,225
Come on, just me, you,
and a bottle of Pinot.

358
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,769
Probably more than one
bottle and some entrees.

359
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,562
And I'll probably get an appetizer.

360
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,439
I own the restaurant, so we can go crazy.

361
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:19,942
- I have to work.
- You don't have to work.

362
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,487
- You choose to work.
- Hmm.

363
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,781
Why not choose to be happy for once?

364
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:27,783
Mm.

365
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,870
When you're writing a memoir,

366
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,706
you spend a lot of time
reflecting on the past.

367
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,584
I regret not being a better friend to you

368
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,294
and lover.

369
00:14:39,377 --> 00:14:40,587
Thank you.

370
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,006
Lover's kind of a weird word,

371
00:14:42,088 --> 00:14:43,674
but thanks.

372
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,759
You want to get out of
this stuffy old restaurant,

373
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,219
get some gelato, and maybe
drive out to the ocean

374
00:14:48,303 --> 00:14:51,598
- and put our feet in the water?
- That sounds great.

375
00:14:51,723 --> 00:14:53,600
Let me just freshen up my whiskers.

376
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,020
Great. I'll get the car
and meet you outside.

377
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:57,521
You scamper right back, pussycat.

378
00:14:57,604 --> 00:14:59,064
You look at your reflection too long,

379
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:00,649
you might fall in love. She's gone.

380
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,695
What do you want, Gekko?

381
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,655
Well, I was hoping to
talk to you face-to-face,

382
00:15:06,738 --> 00:15:08,490
but I guess you had to leave work early.

383
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:10,325
I left at 8:30. What is it?

384
00:15:10,408 --> 00:15:13,745
Well, Cate and I had a
really good talk today.

385
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,622
We have so much in common,

386
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,958
and especially since I'm
doing so much for Eva Braun,

387
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,418
it almost seemed weird
that I wasn't repping her.

388
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,754
No. No. No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

389
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,131
She and I are both
high-powered working mothers,

390
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,551
so I understand her priorities,

391
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:29,594
so she's switching to Gekko.

392
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,263
Wow, being a mom helped my career?

393
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:34,432
I really can have it all.

394
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,935
This isn't fair. I know
everything about Cate.

395
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,436
Her favorite color is red.

396
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,230
Her favorite book is Suffragette City.

397
00:15:40,313 --> 00:15:41,857
Her favorite Spice Girl is Baby.

398
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,525
I know all I need to know,

399
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:45,235
which is that she's
beautiful, she's British,

400
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:46,653
and she's gonna make me a lot of money.

401
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,613
She's Australian, you moron.

402
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,407
If you need me, I'll be at work.

403
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,867
Bye.

404
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,952
Bye.

405
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,787
Ugh.

406
00:15:57,288 --> 00:15:59,290
Uh, telephone.

407
00:15:59,374 --> 00:16:00,834
Charlie, get me Cate Blanchett.

408
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:04,295
Um, who is... Okay, I don't...

409
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:07,382
Uh, uh, sorry, I can't...

410
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:09,927
Oh, sticky.

411
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,762
You know what? Never mind.

412
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,973
If Vanessa Gekko wants Cate
that bad, she can have her.

413
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,935
I'm gonna be okay. I'm gonna be happy.

414
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:21,229
Tonight, I choose to be happy.

415
00:16:21,312 --> 00:16:23,774
Hello? I think I put you on mute.

416
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,859
Good night, Charlie.

417
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,617
Holy shit.

418
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,203
Herb! How the hell are you, buddy?

419
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,039
Ruin any lives lately?

420
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,499
- Excuse me?
- I got your message, asshole.

421
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,836
You got something to say to me,

422
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,838
you come out to Malibu
and say it to my face.

423
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:50,300
I'll be alive tomorrow.
After that, who knows?

424
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,680
Sorry that took me so long.

425
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,266
Just wanted to look my best for you, lover.

426
00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:03,730
Hey, um, I just got kind
of a weird phone call.

427
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:07,651
You and me both. Hey, screw 'em all, right?

428
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:09,987
Yeah.

429
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,571
Are we going to gelato?

430
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,865
Princess Carolyn, what are we doing?

431
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,993
Getting gelato?

432
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:21,665
This was a mistake. I've been acting crazy.

433
00:17:21,748 --> 00:17:24,626
That phone call just
pulled me back to reality.

434
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:26,336
You were right. I don't love you.

435
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:28,797
You don't love me. We're
just two lonely people

436
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,299
trying to hate ourselves a little less.

437
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:34,052
Maybe that's all we're ever gonna be.

438
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,054
Maybe that's all we ever were.

439
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:39,099
Well, this night took a turn.

440
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:45,063
You know the worst part? I
knew this was gonna happen

441
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,816
and I let myself get excited anyway.

442
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:50,485
So we agree that this is on you, then?

443
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:57,117
I guess I'll see you around.

444
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,369
You're not even gonna give me a ride home?

445
00:17:59,452 --> 00:18:02,455
Sorry, I think I just
need to be alone right now.

446
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,086
Of course, of course.

447
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,839
That's what you get when
you fall for a horse.

448
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:12,257
Taxi.

449
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:15,719
You got to get your shit together.

450
00:18:15,802 --> 00:18:17,762
So yesterday, you let yourself
fall in love a little bit,

451
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,556
and you got your heart broken.

452
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,599
Serves you right for having feelings.

453
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:24,394
Starting now, you are a
hard, heartless career gal.

454
00:18:24,477 --> 00:18:26,354
Go to work, be awesome at it,

455
00:18:26,437 --> 00:18:28,439
and don't waste time on
foolish flights of fancy.

456
00:18:28,523 --> 00:18:30,483
From now on, you are a robot.

457
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,610
Beep bop boop blurp bleep.

458
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:39,201
- Hello.
- I just want you to know I'm fine.

459
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,786
Uh-oh. People only say they're
fine when they're not fine.

460
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,621
Did I hurt your feelings last night?

461
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,540
I'm an agent. I don't have feelings.

462
00:18:45,623 --> 00:18:47,084
Well, I'm glad you called.

463
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,418
I think that you had
the right idea yesterday.

464
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:49,711
I should be getting back to work.

465
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:51,421
Can you get me another job?

466
00:18:51,504 --> 00:18:53,257
Yeah, well, I'm not your
agent anymore, so, no.

467
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:55,884
Oh, right. Well, just tell whoever, then.

468
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:57,385
Haah!

469
00:18:57,468 --> 00:18:58,636
Whoa.

470
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,141
Asshole!

471
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,602
Anyway, I'm off to
Malibu to see Herb Kazzaz.

472
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:07,896
He has cancer, which, as
you know, is a whole thing.

473
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:10,607
Plus, he hates me, so I could
really use some good news

474
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,775
at the end of the day.

475
00:19:11,858 --> 00:19:13,777
Oh, my God, you're going to see Herb?

476
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,112
You must be really...

477
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,988
Nope, don't care. Not interested.

478
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,117
Hope you like kicking ass, Charlie,

479
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,993
because that's all we're gonna do today.

480
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,246
My tie got stuck in
the copier this morning.

481
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,747
That's great, Charlie.

482
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,457
If you flip them real quick,

483
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,001
it looks like the tie is running.

484
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,503
Hey, Vanessa, your client,
BoJack Horseman, wants a job.

485
00:19:32,587 --> 00:19:34,380
- Good luck.
- Oh, yeah, about that.

486
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,049
Gwyneth came in this morning,

487
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,093
and I wanted to show her
that she was a top priority,

488
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:40,011
so I shredded BoJack's contract

489
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,387
right in front of her. Heh heh

490
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,473
What? You just signed BoJack yesterday.

491
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:46,559
I say good riddance to Mr. Houseman

492
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,353
or whatever that horse's name is.

493
00:19:48,436 --> 00:19:50,688
It's not like he makes
this company any money,

494
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,650
and he does seem to take up
an awful lot of your time.

495
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:57,112
I'm from Arizona, Jerry.
I went to Arizona State.

496
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:59,239
Todd, how do I turn this thing off?

497
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,615
Todd.

498
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:02,575
What? I'm busy.

499
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,703
Never mind. Think I've figured it out.

500
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,290
Now that I've got the room to myself,

501
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,583
time to practice the trombone.

502
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,715
He's kind of in a bad place right now.

503
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,217
You can't just drop him.

504
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,677
The best agent in this building

505
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,262
couldn't get that guy a job.

506
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,347
The best agent in this building

507
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:24,889
got him a job yesterday,

508
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,225
and I could get him a
feature by the end of today.

509
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,810
If you want to get him a movie

510
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:30,603
by the end of the day, great, do that.

511
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,689
Otherwise, we are washing our hands of him.

512
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:36,401
Charlie, I hear NBC picked
up your running tie show.

513
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:38,444
Congratulations.

514
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,530
Thank you, Dad.

515
00:20:42,782 --> 00:20:45,410
Hey, Marty, Princess Carolyn here.

516
00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:48,288
How'd you like to work
with the BoJack Horseman?

517
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,415
What's that? You hate his guts?

518
00:20:50,498 --> 00:20:52,750
What's that? He's a talentless boob?

519
00:20:54,627 --> 00:20:56,796
What's that? You'll never
work with BoJack again?

520
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,964
What's that?

521
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,342
You want him to die in an
ass factory warehouse fire,

522
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,220
smothering to death under
a pile of burning asses?

523
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,680
Well, if you change your
mind, give me a call.

524
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:07,724
Oh, BoJack, what am I gonna do with you?

525
00:21:07,807 --> 00:21:08,808
I don't understand

526
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,727
why you're going through
all this trouble for him.

527
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,896
That guy's dead weight, Princess Carolyn.

528
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:15,523
If you don't cut him loose,
you're never gonna be happy.

529
00:21:15,606 --> 00:21:17,275
Help me help you.

530
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,278
That's it. Of course.

531
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,322
Cameron Crow, you skinny bitch.

532
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,158
You know Jerry Maguire's my
favorite movie of all time?

533
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,910
All your films are so human,

534
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:29,120
which is super impressive
since you're a crow.

535
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,164
Well, my name is Cameron Crow,

536
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,707
but I'm actually a raven,

537
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,667
so common misconception.

538
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,211
- Well, whatever you are...
- A raven.

539
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:38,880
- I brought you this
- Suffragette City...

540
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:41,341
"a coming of age story about rock music,

541
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:45,429
being a teenager in the
'80s and buying zoos"?

542
00:21:45,511 --> 00:21:47,264
How have I not heard of this book?

543
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,432
You'd be the perfect director

544
00:21:48,514 --> 00:21:49,599
to make a movie out of it,

545
00:21:49,682 --> 00:21:51,184
and I happen to know this is

546
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,477
Cate Blanchett's favorite book.

547
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,687
I'll bet she'll drop
everything to play the part.

548
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,647
You should give her a caw.

549
00:21:56,731 --> 00:21:59,484
Okay, I see... Yeah. Caw is what crows say.

550
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:02,070
Again, I am not a crow.

551
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:08,201
Cate, listen to me, you're
making a big mistake.

552
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,495
Eva Braun is your dream, remember?

553
00:22:10,578 --> 00:22:12,747
Cate? Hello?

554
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,749
Cate!

555
00:22:14,832 --> 00:22:16,542
Oh, no. What happened?

556
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,753
Did Cate drop out of your
little Holocaust movie

557
00:22:18,836 --> 00:22:21,798
so she could make my
little Cameron Crow movie?

558
00:22:21,881 --> 00:22:23,758
Why don't you go home and cry about it

559
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:25,718
to your loving husband and children?

560
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,304
Say, which one of you

561
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,264
is overseeing the Eva Braun package?

562
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,015
That would be me, sir.

563
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,226
Vanessa, you really
shat the bed on this one.

564
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,686
- Now, are you fired?
- Not exactly.

565
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,522
- Can you still work here?
- No.

566
00:22:37,605 --> 00:22:39,190
Lenny Turteltaub here to see you.

567
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,025
Thanks, Laura.

568
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,111
So, one minute I'm making
a movie with Cate Blanchett.

569
00:22:43,194 --> 00:22:44,988
Next, I hear she's doing
a picture with Cameron Crow

570
00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:46,323
about mix tapes.

571
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:47,865
As I said to Ed Porter

572
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,575
at the premiere of The Great Train Robbery,

573
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,828
"Aah, the train's coming right at me."

574
00:22:51,911 --> 00:22:53,871
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know, Lenny.

575
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,623
Eva Braun was Vanessa's project.

576
00:22:55,706 --> 00:22:57,250
All that work for nothing.

577
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,419
Now Quentin Tarantulino's
got four arms up my ass

578
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,505
'cause he got all excited
about making a rom-com.

579
00:23:01,587 --> 00:23:03,589
You know what would be
a great romantic comedy?

580
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,967
Remember when that guy stole
the D from the Hollywood sign

581
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,052
so he could propose to his girlfriend?

582
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,929
That would make a great movie,

583
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,306
but who would play the lead?

584
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,517
Preferably someone kind of washed up.

585
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,559
You know how much Quentin

586
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:15,893
loves to revitalize dead careers.

587
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,479
It's kind of his thing.

588
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,605
Well, in that case,
you know who'd be great?

589
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,941
Show me the money.

590
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:26,279
- Yeah.
- Good news.

591
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,989
You're back in my stable,

592
00:23:28,072 --> 00:23:31,075
and I got you the lead
in a romantic comedy.

593
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,077
Who's the best agent in the world?

594
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,245
What?

595
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,873
I went through hell and back
today, but it was worth it

596
00:23:36,956 --> 00:23:40,210
because I got you a
job. Aren't you excited?

597
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,753
No. I don't know.

598
00:23:42,837 --> 00:23:44,714
I don't care about that.

599
00:23:44,797 --> 00:23:47,758
You... You said you wanted a job.

600
00:23:47,842 --> 00:23:50,345
It doesn't matter. Nothing matters.

601
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:53,931
- Wow. What happened in Malibu?
- I got to go.

602
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,727
Need anything else?

603
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:01,231
No, thanks, Laura. Go
home. I'll see you tomorrow.

604
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,732
Are you gonna head out soon?

605
00:24:02,815 --> 00:24:05,402
Where else would I go?

606
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,416
Happy birthday, Princess Carolyn.

607
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:22,586
Thanks, phone.

608
00:24:22,668 --> 00:24:24,754
