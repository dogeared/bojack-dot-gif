1
00:00:06,313 --> 00:00:08,732
Say when.

2
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:12,194
When.

3
00:00:12,277 --> 00:00:14,446
Yeah, you'll
never guess who's here.

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,198
Think '90s.

5
00:00:16,281 --> 00:00:19,952
No, BoJack Horseman from Horsin' Around.

6
00:00:20,036 --> 00:00:21,787
No, I mean, he got a little fatter,

7
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:23,372
but it's definitely him.

8
00:00:23,455 --> 00:00:25,958
He looks really sad. It's hilarious.

9
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,669
Get over here now.

10
00:00:32,381 --> 00:00:34,174
I told you, I don't know where it is.

11
00:00:34,257 --> 00:00:36,760
Don't put things in my
butt if you want them back.

12
00:00:38,261 --> 00:00:41,098
And hold for Princess Carolyn, please.

13
00:00:41,181 --> 00:00:42,307
Thanks, Laura.

BoJack, it's your favorite agent.

18
00:00:51,358 --> 00:00:52,985
Yeah, some agent, you couldn't even get me

19
00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:54,486
in the room for War Horse.

20
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,321
There were, like, ten horses in that movie.

21
00:00:56,405 --> 00:00:57,990
I didn't need to be the warhorse.

22
00:00:58,074 --> 00:00:59,783
Listen, dummy, I want to
make sure you're all set

23
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:01,451
for your first day with Diane tomorrow.

24
00:01:01,535 --> 00:01:03,662
Is she gonna ask me a
bunch of personal questions?

25
00:01:03,746 --> 00:01:06,040
The woman we're paying
to ghostwrite your memoir?

26
00:01:06,123 --> 00:01:07,499
Yeah, probably.

27
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:09,376
Okay, all right, there's no need to get...

28
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:11,545
What, catty? Are you gonna say catty?

29
00:01:11,628 --> 00:01:14,798
- I was not gonna say catty.
- Oh, what were you gonna say?

30
00:01:14,882 --> 00:01:17,551
I was gonna say catty because you're a cat.

31
00:01:17,634 --> 00:01:19,386
Goodbye, BoJack.

32
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:21,263
Laura, I know you're
listening. You got it, right?

33
00:01:21,346 --> 00:01:23,306
Laura, do not respond
to him. Goodbye, BoJack.

34
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,351
She got it.

35
00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:31,648
Oh, my God. Take another one.

36
00:01:31,732 --> 00:01:33,984
Take another one.

37
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,448
Excuse me, I just wanted you to know

38
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:41,700
that you ruined someone
else's night tonight,

39
00:01:41,784 --> 00:01:43,577
and I hope you have enough decency

40
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,829
to at least feel a little
bit crappy about it.

41
00:01:45,913 --> 00:01:47,123
Excuse me?

42
00:01:47,205 --> 00:01:48,999
I was actually already in a bad mood,

43
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,584
but I thought maybe for one night,

44
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:53,629
I could go out to a bar and
try to forget about myself,

45
00:01:53,712 --> 00:01:55,213
but now because of you and your friends,

46
00:01:55,297 --> 00:01:57,549
I feel more self-conscious than ever.

47
00:01:57,633 --> 00:01:58,884
If we were bothering you so much,

48
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:00,594
why didn't you just leave?

49
00:02:00,677 --> 00:02:02,930
Because I didn't think of
that, and now I feel stupid.

50
00:02:03,013 --> 00:02:04,140
Look, I have a right to be here.

51
00:02:04,222 --> 00:02:05,641
No!

52
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:08,644
Maybe because you're skinny
and maybe 'cause you're pretty,

53
00:02:08,727 --> 00:02:10,395
you're used to getting away with things,

54
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,773
but I want you to know that your actions

55
00:02:12,856 --> 00:02:15,317
have an effect on others, and I hate you,

56
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,194
and you are a horrible person,

57
00:02:17,277 --> 00:02:20,238
and you not understanding
that you're a horrible person

58
00:02:20,322 --> 00:02:24,326
doesn't make you less of a horrible person.

59
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:26,369
You think I'm pretty?

60
00:02:34,294 --> 00:02:35,838
Well, that was another in a long series

61
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:37,589
of regrettable life choices.

62
00:02:37,673 --> 00:02:39,216
What'd you say?

63
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:42,302
I was tweeting about all the
weird stuff you do in bed.

64
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:36,417
sync and corrections by <font color="#FF0000">dreaMaker7</font>
www.addic7ed.com

65
00:03:41,945 --> 00:03:43,239
- Good morning.
- Ah!

66
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:44,281
Why are you here?

67
00:03:44,406 --> 00:03:45,615
I slept here.

68
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:46,992
Yeah, but why are you still here?

69
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:48,493
Breakfast.

70
00:03:48,577 --> 00:03:50,328
That better not be my last Toaster Strudel.

71
00:03:50,412 --> 00:03:51,747
No, there were three left.

72
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,040
Well, get out of here.

73
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:55,125
My memoirist is gonna show up soon,

74
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:56,710
and I don't need you...

75
00:03:56,793 --> 00:03:58,503
- What's your name?
- Pam.

76
00:03:58,587 --> 00:04:02,549
I don't need you Pam-ing up
the place when she gets here.

77
00:04:02,632 --> 00:04:05,219
- Hey, BoJack.
- Ah! Why are you here?

78
00:04:05,302 --> 00:04:07,512
- You told me to come at 9:00.
- That doesn't sound like me.

79
00:04:07,596 --> 00:04:09,514
I have your email right here.

80
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:12,475
"Diane, why don't you come
over Tuesday morning at 9:00?

81
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:14,352
Also, you should bring this email with you

82
00:04:14,436 --> 00:04:16,021
because I might not remember
it because I just took

83
00:04:16,105 --> 00:04:18,274
a bunch of horse tranquilizers, ha ha.

84
00:04:18,356 --> 00:04:19,691
Also, please don't put in my book

85
00:04:19,775 --> 00:04:21,568
that I use horse tranquilizers, ha ha.

86
00:04:21,651 --> 00:04:23,862
I just use a small dose to
help me fall asleep at night

87
00:04:23,946 --> 00:04:25,488
and then a much, much larger dose

88
00:04:25,572 --> 00:04:27,032
to get me through the day.

89
00:04:27,116 --> 00:04:28,575
Also, I'm drunk.

90
00:04:28,658 --> 00:04:31,745
Also, I'm alone, so alone, so, so alone.

91
00:04:31,828 --> 00:04:33,538
Please don't put that in my book,

92
00:04:33,622 --> 00:04:36,083
book, book, book 'em, dildo.

93
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,918
Does it taste like magenta in here?"

94
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:39,669
Then I think you fell
asleep on the keyboard

95
00:04:39,753 --> 00:04:42,005
because it just says
the letter "B" 27 times.

96
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:43,715
That does sound like me.

97
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:45,675
Well, anyway, this is my businessperson...

98
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,219
Excuse me?

99
00:04:47,303 --> 00:04:49,096
Here to help me with some business needs.

100
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:51,098
- All very above board.
- Uh, what'd you say?

101
00:04:51,181 --> 00:04:52,599
No need to mention her in the book either,

102
00:04:52,682 --> 00:04:53,892
unless it's a business book.

103
00:04:53,976 --> 00:04:57,104
Ha ha, classic BoJack.

104
00:04:57,187 --> 00:04:58,897
Why are you here?

105
00:04:58,981 --> 00:05:02,318
Oh, funny story, I'm
filming a reality show later,

106
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,363
so I thought I'd drop by with
the old tennis ball and chain.

107
00:05:06,446 --> 00:05:09,325
That is neither funny nor a story

108
00:05:09,407 --> 00:05:11,243
nor a reason for you to drop by.

109
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:13,203
Aw, he just wanted to come over and brag

110
00:05:13,287 --> 00:05:14,746
about his reality show.

111
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,208
Get this, I am starring
in a pilot presentation

112
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:20,377
for a celebrity reality show.

113
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,670
It's pretty cutting edge, huh?

114
00:05:21,753 --> 00:05:23,172
Yeah, if it's 2003.

115
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:25,757
Ha ha. Don't tell VH1 that.

116
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:28,177
Seriously, though, please
don't tell VH1 that.

117
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,637
We are calling it Peanutbutter and Jelly.

118
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,014
Get it?

119
00:05:32,097 --> 00:05:34,516
- Because I'm Mr. Peanutbutter.
- Okay, who's jelly?

120
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:36,226
No, no, no. It's like a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich.

121
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,644
It's wordplay.

122
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:39,229
You may have too forgiving a definition

123
00:05:39,313 --> 00:05:40,356
of the word "wordplay."

124
00:05:40,438 --> 00:05:42,232
Well, it's a working title.

125
00:05:42,316 --> 00:05:45,068
Well, it could be working
harder, and that's wordplay.

126
00:05:45,152 --> 00:05:46,403
How'd you even get in here?

127
00:05:46,486 --> 00:05:47,696
Your roommate let us in.

128
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:49,739
Mi casa es su casa.

129
00:05:49,823 --> 00:05:51,825
And that is the last
of the Toaster Strudels,

130
00:05:51,908 --> 00:05:53,327
and now my morning is ruined.

131
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,786
Could you guys keep it down, okay?

132
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,621
I'm kind of on a date right now.

133
00:05:56,705 --> 00:05:59,082
In America,

134
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:02,419
I am actually considered very handsome.

135
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,422
Okay, I'm gonna go get breakfast,

136
00:06:05,505 --> 00:06:07,383
and when I get back, I want
everyone out of my house

137
00:06:07,465 --> 00:06:12,804
except for you and you and...

138
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:15,057
- Who are you again?
- The girl you had sex with.

139
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,267
Right. You definitely should
have already been gone.

140
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,022
I really shouldn't eat chocolate

141
00:06:22,105 --> 00:06:23,773
'cause it can literally kill me.

142
00:06:23,857 --> 00:06:25,401
Oh, I know.

143
00:06:25,483 --> 00:06:28,362
- But I love chocolate.
- Story of my life.

144
00:06:36,912 --> 00:06:38,872
Hey, excuse me.

145
00:06:38,955 --> 00:06:41,875
Yes, I am BoJack Horseman,
star of Horsin' Around.

146
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,377
Yeah, okay, I don't care.

147
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,961
Those are my muffins.

148
00:06:45,045 --> 00:06:46,796
I'm sorry, I... I don't understand.

149
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,007
Did you bring them into the store with you?

150
00:06:49,091 --> 00:06:51,551
No, but I was going to buy them.

151
00:06:51,634 --> 00:06:53,511
That's the last box,
and I had dibs on them.

152
00:06:53,595 --> 00:06:56,056
Really? You had dibs?

153
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:57,891
Yeah, dibs.

154
00:06:57,974 --> 00:06:59,268
I just put them down for a second

155
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:00,852
while I went to the bathroom.

156
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:02,396
Look, I don't even want the muffins.

157
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,314
I was just looking at
them, but I got to say,

158
00:07:04,398 --> 00:07:06,566
if you put muffins down,
they're not your muffins.

159
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:08,026
So what, I was supposed to take them

160
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,652
into the bathroom with me?

161
00:07:09,736 --> 00:07:11,529
You didn't even put the muffins in a cart.

162
00:07:11,613 --> 00:07:12,697
You just left them out here.

163
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:14,824
Yeah, in the produce section.

164
00:07:14,908 --> 00:07:17,286
Clearly, muffins aren't supposed
to be in the produce section.

165
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:19,996
That wasn't a sign to you that
maybe someone else had dibs?

166
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,748
Look, I don't want to get
into a whole thing here.

167
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:23,959
Then give me the muffins.

168
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:27,045
No, 'cause maybe now I want the muffins.

169
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:29,005
You think that because
you're a pseudo-celebrity,

170
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:30,548
normal rules don't apply to you?

171
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:33,343
Pseudo? Would you say
that to Eric McCormack?

172
00:07:33,427 --> 00:07:35,471
Look, I've had a rough
morning, so I don't need...

173
00:07:35,553 --> 00:07:37,139
You've had a rough morning?

174
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:40,517
I spent the last ten months...

175
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,352
Hey!

176
00:07:42,436 --> 00:07:44,980
Sorry, wasn't listening. See ya.

177
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:48,066
You're going to regret
this, BoJack Horseman.

178
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,359
Oh, really?

179
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:51,736
I'm gonna regret buying muffins?

180
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,906
What, have they got a lot
of saturated fat in them?

181
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,992
Oh, man, they do have
a lot of saturated fat.

182
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:59,035
Why'd I buy these?

183
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:05,792
Man, I really regret buying those muffins

184
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,128
and then eating them all on the drive home.

185
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:09,879
Well, my date with Ayako went really well.

186
00:08:09,963 --> 00:08:10,964
Thanks for asking.

187
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:12,424
I specifically didn't ask,

188
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:14,009
and I'll thank you to respect

189
00:08:14,092 --> 00:08:15,677
my total lack of interest
in your personal life.

190
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,053
She's hilarious.

191
00:08:17,137 --> 00:08:19,055
I never met a girl who was so curious

192
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:20,849
about American bank routing numbers.

193
00:08:20,932 --> 00:08:22,100
Still not interested.

194
00:08:22,184 --> 00:08:23,477
Should we get started on the book?

195
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,936
What's your hurry?

196
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,355
What do you guys think I should get Ayako

197
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:28,357
for our 12-hour anniversary?

198
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,318
She wants a framed picture
of my mother's maiden name.

199
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:32,694
Okay, let's get to work.

200
00:08:36,656 --> 00:08:38,116
Let's start at the beginning.

201
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,118
What was your childhood like?

202
00:08:40,202 --> 00:08:42,329
- Normal.
- Normal?

203
00:08:42,412 --> 00:08:45,541
Yeah, it was, uh, normal...
normal childhood stuff.

204
00:08:45,623 --> 00:08:47,709
Here's your omelet.

205
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:49,085
I'm sorry it's not as good

206
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:51,004
as the omelets your secretary makes,

207
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:53,173
but then you're not married
to your secretary, are you?

208
00:08:53,256 --> 00:08:56,301
Well, maybe if my secretary
also refused to get an abortion,

209
00:08:56,385 --> 00:08:57,427
I would be.

210
00:08:57,511 --> 00:08:59,388
Mommy, can I have an omelet?

211
00:08:59,471 --> 00:09:01,306
You're the birthday boy.

212
00:09:02,891 --> 00:09:04,393
Normal childhood,

213
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:07,062
and then just get right
into the big, famous part.

214
00:09:07,145 --> 00:09:08,855
Look, if you're not ready
to talk, we can wait.

215
00:09:08,938 --> 00:09:10,482
I am ready to talk.

216
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:12,067
Why wouldn't I want to
talk about my parents?

217
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,402
They're so normal. That's crazy.

218
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:15,237
You sound like a crazy person, not me.

219
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,654
Stop being so crazy, crazy.

220
00:09:16,738 --> 00:09:18,448
Why are you calling me crazy?

221
00:09:18,532 --> 00:09:21,368
Okay. Was your father...

222
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:22,994
Hold on, I got to take this. Hello?

223
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:24,954
Hey, BoJack, I've got
Princess Carolyn for you.

224
00:09:25,038 --> 00:09:26,582
- It's urgent.
- Great, put her on.

225
00:09:26,664 --> 00:09:27,832
Just a sec. I'll see if she's available.

226
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,626
♪ When you're walking alone ♪

227
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:31,753
♪ Because Jellicles are ♪
♪ And... ♪

228
00:09:31,836 --> 00:09:34,548
BoJack, are you watching MSNBSea right now?

229
00:09:34,631 --> 00:09:35,965
Great question.

230
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:37,384
Well, I didn't fall down on my remote,

231
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:39,677
randomly changing the channel to MSNBSea

232
00:09:39,761 --> 00:09:41,971
while simultaneously crippling myself,

233
00:09:42,055 --> 00:09:45,601
thus physically forcing
me to watch MSNBSea, so no.

234
00:09:45,683 --> 00:09:48,270
No, I'm not watching MSNBSea right now.

235
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:50,105
Yeah, well, Hamlet, you
might want to turn it on.

236
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:51,231
They're talking about you.

237
00:09:51,314 --> 00:09:52,899
Ooh! Good things, I hope.

238
00:09:57,237 --> 00:09:59,781
Our guest via satellite is Neal McBeal,

239
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:02,325
a naval officer on leave from Afghanistan.

240
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:03,577
Welcome to the program, Neal.

241
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,744
Thank you, Tom.

242
00:10:04,827 --> 00:10:06,580
Hey, I met this guy.

243
00:10:06,663 --> 00:10:08,873
All Neal wanted when he got home...

244
00:10:08,957 --> 00:10:12,294
and I emphasize, from Afghanistan...

245
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:16,089
was his favorite brand
of breakfast muffins.

246
00:10:16,172 --> 00:10:18,258
When he went to the
supermarket and called dibs

247
00:10:18,341 --> 00:10:19,551
on the last box...

248
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:21,428
Well, tell us what happened, Neal.

249
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:25,599
BoJack Horseman, from the
'90s sitcom Horsin' Around,

250
00:10:25,682 --> 00:10:27,643
refused to respect my dibs.

251
00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:30,186
Have you no shame, BoJack Horseman?

252
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,188
Seen here sneezing at a Christmas party.

253
00:10:32,272 --> 00:10:33,773
Oh, not the sneezing pic...

254
00:10:33,856 --> 00:10:35,525
Why do they always use
the sneezing picture?

255
00:10:35,609 --> 00:10:37,694
In the '90s, we laughed at your antics.

256
00:10:37,777 --> 00:10:40,071
Oh, how we laughed. "Ha ha ha,"

257
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:41,906
we chortled in rapturous glee.

258
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,535
But when you deny the dibs
called by our men and women

259
00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:47,829
on the frontlines, that
is a sick joke, sir.

260
00:10:47,912 --> 00:10:50,499
A sick, sick joke, indeed,

261
00:10:50,582 --> 00:10:52,834
and you'll forgive me
if I chortle no longer,

262
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:55,671
for, to me, there is
nothing the least bit funny

263
00:10:55,753 --> 00:10:59,341
about stealing a meal from
Neal McBeal, the Navy SEAL.

264
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:04,137
Wait, wait, you stole
muffins from a Navy SEAL?

265
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,722
I didn't know he was a Navy SEAL.

266
00:11:05,805 --> 00:11:07,182
I just thought he was
the regular kind of seal.

267
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:09,267
This is classic Hollywood elitism.

268
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:11,311
BoJack Horseman thinks
that because he was on TV,

269
00:11:11,394 --> 00:11:13,021
that makes him better than everybody.

270
00:11:13,104 --> 00:11:15,649
Well, guess what, BoJack, now I'm on TV,

271
00:11:15,732 --> 00:11:17,400
so now I'm better than everybody!

272
00:11:17,484 --> 00:11:19,361
That's right, Neal.

273
00:11:19,444 --> 00:11:21,946
You didn't even have
dibs, you stupid sea cow.

274
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,199
You guys think I should call
in and set the record straight?

275
00:11:24,282 --> 00:11:26,784
BoJack, these people feed off controversy.

276
00:11:26,868 --> 00:11:28,953
If you dignify the story with a
response, it's just gonna fan...

277
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:30,580
I'm now receiving word

278
00:11:30,664 --> 00:11:33,542
that we've got BoJack himself on the phone.

279
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:34,917
Sorry, stopped listening.

280
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:36,503
You were ramping up to a "yes," right?

281
00:11:36,586 --> 00:11:38,171
BoJack, what you did today

282
00:11:38,254 --> 00:11:40,340
was a slap in the face of America's heroes.

283
00:11:40,423 --> 00:11:43,801
Will you apologize?

284
00:11:43,885 --> 00:11:46,137
Okay, enough about America's heroes.

285
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:47,847
Can we talk about dibs?

286
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,932
Because he didn't even really have dibs.

287
00:11:50,016 --> 00:11:51,393
If he had legitimate dibs...

288
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:52,852
Oh, I had dibs on the muffins.

289
00:11:52,935 --> 00:11:55,230
I hid them in the produce section!

290
00:11:55,313 --> 00:11:56,773
You left them totally out in the open.

291
00:11:56,856 --> 00:11:58,274
That's hiding?

292
00:11:58,358 --> 00:11:59,693
How did you survive in Afghanistan?

293
00:11:59,776 --> 00:12:00,943
Those are my muffins!

294
00:12:01,027 --> 00:12:02,904
You give me back my muffins!

295
00:12:02,987 --> 00:12:04,531
Hey, guess what, I can't give them back

296
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:05,741
'cause I ate them all, okay?

297
00:12:05,782 --> 00:12:07,367
Dude.

298
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,411
Hold on, just to be
clear, since this morning,

299
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:11,413
you ate all the muffins?

300
00:12:11,496 --> 00:12:13,164
Yeah, I ate them all in one sitting

301
00:12:13,248 --> 00:12:15,542
because I have no
self-control and I hate myself.

302
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,419
Is that what you want to hear?

303
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:18,795
Neal, was it a small container of muffins,

304
00:12:18,878 --> 00:12:20,463
like two to four muffins?

305
00:12:20,547 --> 00:12:23,341
No, Tom, there were a
good deal more than that.

306
00:12:23,425 --> 00:12:25,385
Can you remember exactly how
many muffins were in the box?

307
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:27,345
Yeah, there were exactly 12!

308
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:31,140
I ate 12 muffins, and
I didn't even want one!

309
00:12:31,224 --> 00:12:33,393
There's your goddamn news story,

310
00:12:33,476 --> 00:12:37,021
the mystery of my missing
goddamn self-respect!

311
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,860
How'd I come off?

312
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:46,615
Well, that went slightly
better than the worst

313
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,411
it could have possibly gone, so hooray?

314
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,416
It's not even about the muffins.

315
00:12:56,499 --> 00:12:58,460
Everyone is just out to get me

316
00:12:58,543 --> 00:13:00,336
because I'm famous and so well-adjusted.

317
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,088
Well, at least you've got some privacy.

318
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:04,674
My boyfriend's filming a
reality show at our house.

319
00:13:04,758 --> 00:13:06,676
If I want to be alone,
I have to go to the roof

320
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,637
because it's the only place they
don't have insurance to film.

321
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,887
You go on the roof?

322
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:11,889
Yeah, just to get some work done.

323
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:13,224
Is that really weird?

324
00:13:13,308 --> 00:13:14,976
No, it's adorable.

325
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:17,145
When I was a kid, I used
to climb onto the roof

326
00:13:17,228 --> 00:13:19,188
with my dad and look at the stars.

327
00:13:19,272 --> 00:13:20,273
What about you?

328
00:13:20,356 --> 00:13:22,150
Were you close with your father?

329
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:24,444
Happy Father's Day, Daddy.

330
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:26,195
What is this supposed to be, a lima bean?

331
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,697
It's a heart.

332
00:13:27,781 --> 00:13:30,408
That's some shoddy craftsmanship, son.

333
00:13:30,492 --> 00:13:32,494
- I tried my best.
- No, you didn't.

334
00:13:32,577 --> 00:13:34,120
You slacked off and took the easy way out.

335
00:13:34,203 --> 00:13:35,538
In this world, you can either

336
00:13:35,622 --> 00:13:37,123
do things the easy way or the right way.

337
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:38,541
You take a boat from here to New York,

338
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,293
you gonna go around the
horn like a gentleman

339
00:13:40,376 --> 00:13:43,045
or cut through the Panama Canal
like some kind of democrat?

340
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:44,589
Um, the canal?

341
00:13:44,673 --> 00:13:48,301
You go around the horn
the way God intended!

342
00:13:48,384 --> 00:13:49,385
Uneventful.

343
00:13:49,469 --> 00:13:51,596
- What?
- What?

344
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,431
I asked if you were close with your father,

345
00:13:53,515 --> 00:13:55,475
and you sat here in
silence for five minutes

346
00:13:55,558 --> 00:13:57,769
and then said, "Uneventful."

347
00:13:57,853 --> 00:14:00,522
You know what, this is a
really good conversation,

348
00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:02,106
and I definitely want to keep having it,

349
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,150
but I just keep thinking
about the muffins thing,

350
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:06,194
so maybe we could put a pin in this

351
00:14:06,277 --> 00:14:07,654
thorough deconstruction of my past,

352
00:14:07,737 --> 00:14:08,905
so I can put that other thing

353
00:14:08,988 --> 00:14:10,657
to bed before it spirals out of con...

354
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,325
I had dibs!

355
00:14:12,408 --> 00:14:14,911
- My dibs were on those muffins!
- Your dibs were void!

356
00:14:14,994 --> 00:14:18,748
I spent a year in Afghanistan
making America safer,

357
00:14:18,832 --> 00:14:20,876
and this is the thanks I get?

358
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,961
Really, you, specifically,
made America safer?

359
00:14:24,045 --> 00:14:26,631
Well, BoJack, surely, even you would agree

360
00:14:26,715 --> 00:14:27,716
that the troops are heroes.

361
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:29,551
I don't agree to that.

362
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:32,261
Maybe some of the troops are
heroes but not automatically.

363
00:14:32,345 --> 00:14:33,889
I'm sure a lot of the troops are jerks.

364
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:35,682
Most people are jerks already,

365
00:14:35,765 --> 00:14:37,684
and it's not like giving a
jerk a gun and telling him

366
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:39,018
it's okay to kill people

367
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:41,730
suddenly turns that jerk into a hero.

368
00:14:43,523 --> 00:14:44,691
What?

369
00:14:45,942 --> 00:14:49,696
Did you just say you
think the troops are jerks?

370
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:52,031
Oh, you took that the bad way, didn't you?

371
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,285
I'm sure a lot of the troops are jerks.

372
00:14:56,369 --> 00:14:57,495
No, no, no.

373
00:14:57,579 --> 00:14:59,664
- The troops are jerks?
- Oh, God.

374
00:14:59,748 --> 00:15:01,165
Most people are jerks already,

375
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:02,625
and it's not like giving a jerk a gun...

376
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:05,253
Hello?

377
00:15:05,336 --> 00:15:06,796
Princess Carolyn needs to
talk to you immediately.

378
00:15:06,922 --> 00:15:08,005
Great, put her on.

379
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:09,841
She's actually just
getting out of a meeting.

380
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:12,260
- Can you hold for a sec?
- You called me.

385

- Ah!

386
00:15:22,812 --> 00:15:24,439
I'm gonna level with you, honey.

387
00:15:24,522 --> 00:15:28,192
This whole you hating the
troops thing is not great.

388
00:15:28,276 --> 00:15:29,569
I don't hate the troops.

389
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:32,655
I just hate one specific troop.
I don't even hate him, really.

390
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:35,116
I just think that he's
wrong about the muffins.

391
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,034
I know, BoJack... just like always,

392
00:15:37,118 --> 00:15:38,578
You're right, and everyone else is wrong.

393
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:39,662
But if you don't swallow your pride,

394
00:15:39,746 --> 00:15:41,372
this is never gonna let up.

395
00:15:41,456 --> 00:15:43,124
- I know you're stubborn...
- I'm not stubborn.

396
00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:44,793
- I'm proud.
- That's kind of the same thing.

397
00:15:44,876 --> 00:15:46,419
No, it's an important distinction.

398
00:15:46,502 --> 00:15:48,170
Okay, fine. You're not stubborn.

399
00:15:48,254 --> 00:15:50,465
But I'm about to tell you
something very important,

400
00:15:50,548 --> 00:15:52,884
so I want you to listen carefully.

401
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:55,094
I'm getting another call.

402
00:15:55,177 --> 00:15:56,596
I'm gonna have to put you on hold.

It is now day three of the
great BoJack jerk-off...

406
00:16:06,272 --> 00:16:07,816
Really?

407
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:09,943
That's the name we came up with for this?

408
00:16:10,026 --> 00:16:12,737
Who came up with that? Was it Randy?

409
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:15,031
Did Randy come up with that?

410
00:16:15,114 --> 00:16:16,741
Anyway, the former television actor

411
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:18,785
who hates our troops has not left his home

412
00:16:18,868 --> 00:16:20,745
since his controversial remarks on Monday

413
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:22,371
about how he hates the troops.

414
00:16:22,455 --> 00:16:24,248
BoJack Horseman makes me sick.

415
00:16:24,332 --> 00:16:26,793
He voiced his opinion, even
though it was unpopular,

416
00:16:26,876 --> 00:16:29,420
and that's the most cowardly
thing a person can do.

417
00:16:29,504 --> 00:16:33,716
After we made love, he covered
himself in sheets like an Arab.

418
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,217
At this very moment,

419
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:37,553
Congress is voting on
a major education bill

420
00:16:37,637 --> 00:16:39,180
that could completely restructure the...

421
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:41,140
Joan, I'm sorry to interrupt you,

422
00:16:41,223 --> 00:16:43,935
but we've got some big news
on the BoJack Horseman front.

423
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:47,396
It appears that BoJack's Lexus
is coming out of the garage.

424
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,273
This is very big news, indeed.

425
00:16:49,357 --> 00:16:51,985
Any comment on BoJack's
controversial remarks this week?

426
00:16:52,068 --> 00:16:55,196
Uh, nope.

427
00:16:56,656 --> 00:16:57,907
So where are we going?

428
00:16:57,991 --> 00:17:00,117
Don't worry, I've got a plan.

429
00:17:00,201 --> 00:17:01,410
Whoa!

430
00:17:01,494 --> 00:17:03,162
Jeez.

431
00:17:03,245 --> 00:17:07,583
Ayako, hey, I need you to
get me three tickets to Kyoto.

Hey, I meant I was rich

438
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:21,597
because I have friends like George Bailey.

Hello?

443
00:17:29,105 --> 00:17:31,024
Well, I'm out of ideas.

444
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:34,110
We can hide out at my
place while we make a plan.

445
00:17:37,488 --> 00:17:40,116
Yeah, great, just get
me away from the cameras.

446
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:43,619
Do we really need to be filming this?

447
00:17:43,703 --> 00:17:45,204
It's for my reality show.

448
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:47,040
You never know when gold's gonna strike.

449
00:17:47,123 --> 00:17:48,958
Yeah, gold doesn't strike.

450
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:50,668
That's why you never know.

451
00:17:50,752 --> 00:17:52,670
BoJack, be nice.

452
00:17:52,754 --> 00:17:54,338
Just pretend they're not there.

453
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:55,840
Okay. Well, I...

454
00:17:55,924 --> 00:17:57,550
Could you speak up, please?

455
00:17:57,633 --> 00:17:59,510
- I'd like to...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

456
00:17:59,594 --> 00:18:00,595
That's too loud.

457
00:18:01,721 --> 00:18:03,472
I want to fix this as quickly as possible.

458
00:18:03,556 --> 00:18:05,266
I don't care who was right
about the muffins anymore,

459
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:06,851
even though I was definitely right.

460
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:09,353
I just want my privacy
back, so I can finish writing

461
00:18:09,437 --> 00:18:12,273
my tell-all memoir, so everyone
will pay attention to me again.

462
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:14,275
I've already reached
out to the McBeal camp.

463
00:18:14,358 --> 00:18:17,570
He's willing to publicly forgive
you if you publicly apologize

464
00:18:17,653 --> 00:18:20,197
and present to him a box
of muffins as a symbol

465
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:22,700
of your great admiration
for the American military

466
00:18:22,784 --> 00:18:23,785
and everything they do.

467
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:25,244
But I ate the muffins.

468
00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:26,370
I know. We got another box.

469
00:18:26,454 --> 00:18:27,830
It's in the cupboard.

470
00:18:27,914 --> 00:18:29,540
Oh, you were saving those? I ate those too.

471
00:18:29,624 --> 00:18:31,584
We've been here for ten minutes!

472
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:33,461
It's okay, we'll get more muffins.

473
00:18:33,544 --> 00:18:35,797
I'll get the muffins, and they're on me.

474
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,633
I just found out I got
80 bucks in the bank.

475
00:18:38,716 --> 00:18:41,260
I'm helping! Hooray!

476
00:18:41,343 --> 00:18:42,511
So where are we gonna do this?

477
00:18:42,595 --> 00:18:44,263
Do I have to go on MSNBSea?

478
00:18:44,346 --> 00:18:46,933
No, we should do it somewhere
people will actually see it.

479
00:18:47,016 --> 00:18:49,644
Oh, why don't you do it
on Peanutbutter and Jelly?

480
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,271
You can't call a show
Peanutbutter and Jelly

481
00:18:52,354 --> 00:18:53,648
if there's no jelly.

482
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:55,357
It's a pun.

483
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:57,152
It's not a pun if it only works one way.

484
00:18:57,234 --> 00:18:58,694
Is this a necessary conversation

485
00:18:58,778 --> 00:19:00,488
to be having right now?

486
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:02,239
Look, I know tempers are high,

487
00:19:02,323 --> 00:19:04,159
but let's not take it
out on the great title

488
00:19:04,241 --> 00:19:05,534
for my reality show,

489
00:19:05,618 --> 00:19:08,287
which we all agree is really clever.

490
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,166
We can edit this to make
me look smart, right?

491
00:19:11,248 --> 00:19:12,667
♪ Yeah ♪

492
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,960
- ♪ Peanutbutter ♪
- ♪ Come on ♪

493
00:19:14,043 --> 00:19:15,461
How's this look? Looks good?

494
00:19:15,544 --> 00:19:18,173
- Okay.
- Marker, sound, speed.

495
00:19:18,255 --> 00:19:20,175
Well, here I am, hanging out

496
00:19:20,257 --> 00:19:22,343
with my good friend BoJack Horseman,

497
00:19:22,426 --> 00:19:24,095
enjoying each other's company,

498
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:26,472
as we often do.

499
00:19:26,555 --> 00:19:28,432
Yes, this is all very
authentic and natural.

500
00:19:29,684 --> 00:19:31,644
Oh, someone's at the door!

501
00:19:31,727 --> 00:19:33,813
I will see who it is.

502
00:19:36,191 --> 00:19:38,400
Wow, this is a surprise.

503
00:19:38,484 --> 00:19:39,735
Neal McBeal.

504
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:41,487
Hello, sir.

505
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,824
Thank you for inviting me
into your home. It is lovely.

506
00:19:44,907 --> 00:19:49,578
BoJack, is there anything
you'd like to give Neal McBeal?

507
00:19:49,662 --> 00:19:50,788
Ahem.

508
00:19:50,872 --> 00:19:52,999
Oh, yeah, Todd?

509
00:19:53,082 --> 00:19:54,250
What the hell is this?

510
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,710
I tried to buy the muffins,

511
00:19:55,793 --> 00:19:58,129
but my bank card got
declined for some reason.

512
00:19:58,213 --> 00:20:00,131
But don't worry, I still saved the day

513
00:20:00,215 --> 00:20:03,384
because I found this bag
of stale hamburger buns.

514
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:05,511
I'm sorry?

515
00:20:05,594 --> 00:20:07,847
Yeah, they're just giving
them away behind In-N-Out.

516
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,141
Why does anybody pay for anything?

517
00:20:10,225 --> 00:20:11,642
Ow.

518
00:20:11,726 --> 00:20:14,103
Uh, Neal, as a token of my admiration,

519
00:20:14,187 --> 00:20:19,108
please accept this bag
of stale hamburger buns.

520
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:21,569
- What?
- Yes, hamburger buns.

521
00:20:21,652 --> 00:20:25,198
It's a symbol for how we throw our veterans

522
00:20:25,281 --> 00:20:27,867
in the trash, sadly, far too often.

523
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,827
I'm listening.

524
00:20:29,911 --> 00:20:31,662
We send our muffins overseas,

525
00:20:31,746 --> 00:20:34,123
and they come back as stale hamburger buns,

526
00:20:34,207 --> 00:20:37,085
but that doesn't mean we
should love them any less,

527
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:38,669
because in their own way,

528
00:20:38,753 --> 00:20:42,673
aren't stale hamburger buns just as good?

529
00:20:42,757 --> 00:20:44,967
Mmm.

530
00:20:45,051 --> 00:20:46,343
American made.

531
00:20:46,427 --> 00:20:50,347
So what you're saying is,

532
00:20:50,431 --> 00:20:52,767
you think I'm a hero.

533
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,060
Well, I don't know if I...

534
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:59,023
Say it, BoJack. Say I'm a hero.

535
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:00,524
You're a hero.

536
00:21:00,608 --> 00:21:04,112
The troops are all
heroes, every single one.

537
00:21:04,195 --> 00:21:05,947
Great.

538
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,616
And I don't believe saying
that cheapens the word

539
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:10,993
and actually disrespects
those we mean to honor

540
00:21:11,077 --> 00:21:14,205
by turning real people
into political pawns.

541
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:17,083
Okay, you can let go of the bag now.

542
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,627
Also, I am not deeply ambivalent

543
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,046
about a seemingly mandated
celebration of our military

544
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,090
by a nation that claims to value peace

545
00:21:24,173 --> 00:21:26,968
telling our children that
violence is never the answer

546
00:21:27,051 --> 00:21:30,138
while refusing to hold our own
government to the same standard.

547
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:32,848
Yeah, me neither. I think
we're in agreement here.

548
00:21:32,932 --> 00:21:35,977
Furthermore, I do not find
it unbelievably appropriate

549
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,021
that this conversation is taking
place on reality television,

550
00:21:39,105 --> 00:21:40,606
a genre which thrives on

551
00:21:40,689 --> 00:21:42,608
chopping the complexities of our era

552
00:21:42,691 --> 00:21:46,195
into easily digestible
chunks of empty catchphrases.

553
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:48,239
Okay.

554
00:21:48,323 --> 00:21:50,074
And finally, I don't...

555
00:21:50,158 --> 00:21:53,911
Hey, look, Mr. Peanutbutter
got a bucket stuck on his head.

556
00:21:53,995 --> 00:21:57,039
Guys, guys, where am I? Can
someone tell me where I am?

557
00:21:57,123 --> 00:21:59,292
Hey, where'd he get that bucket from?

558
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,085
Who gave him a bucket?

559
00:22:03,545 --> 00:22:06,257
Uh, actually, I had another
point I wanted to make.

560
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:09,426
Yeah, but who doesn't love a
dog with a bucket on his head?

561
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,636
Come on.

562
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:12,429
Bucket! Bucket!

563
00:22:12,513 --> 00:22:13,764
Bucket!

564
00:22:13,848 --> 00:22:17,852
Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Bucket!

565
00:22:17,935 --> 00:22:20,229
Hey, can anyone find a handle?

566
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:24,859
Oh, thank you, my friend.

567
00:22:24,942 --> 00:22:26,694
You're a real hero.

568
00:22:26,777 --> 00:22:28,070
Unbelievable.

569
00:22:28,154 --> 00:22:29,446
What's your name, young lady?

570
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,324
Well, my real name's Angela,

571
00:22:31,407 --> 00:22:32,908
but my friends call me Jelly.

572
00:22:32,992 --> 00:22:35,870
What? Oh, my God, did we get that?

573
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:38,455
Please tell me we got that.

574
00:22:45,963 --> 00:22:47,382
You want a day-old hamburger bun?

575
00:22:47,464 --> 00:22:49,591
I'm all right. How'd it go down there?

576
00:22:49,675 --> 00:22:52,011
You know what the
problem is with everybody?

577
00:22:52,094 --> 00:22:54,680
They all just want to hear
what they already believe.

578
00:22:54,763 --> 00:22:56,640
No one ever wants to hear the truth.

579
00:22:56,724 --> 00:22:58,142
I want to hear the truth.

580
00:22:58,226 --> 00:22:59,727
I don't know if you
want to tell it, though.

581
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,270
What do you mean?

582
00:23:01,354 --> 00:23:05,107
Mr. Normal Childhood,
Mr. Uneventful Father?

583
00:23:05,191 --> 00:23:06,692
Look, I can write you the standard

584
00:23:06,775 --> 00:23:08,777
empty-calorie
celebrity tell-some,

585
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:10,279
if that's what you're looking for,

586
00:23:10,363 --> 00:23:11,406
but I thought you might
want more than that.

587
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:13,032
I do.

588
00:23:13,115 --> 00:23:14,658
Well, then you're going to have to open up

589
00:23:14,742 --> 00:23:16,244
and give me something real.

590
00:23:16,327 --> 00:23:17,786
What, you think I can't open up?

591
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:18,954
Well, I don't know if you can or not.

592
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:20,581
You certainly haven't.

593
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:26,754
Okay, from now on, full
truth, warts and all.

594
00:23:26,837 --> 00:23:29,424
You're not gonna make me
look like an asshole, are you?

595
00:23:29,506 --> 00:23:31,592
I don't know, are you an asshole?

596
00:23:33,135 --> 00:23:36,347
Okay, full truth, here we go.

597
00:23:36,431 --> 00:23:38,015
You want to know about my parents?

598
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:40,101
They drank a lot.

599
00:23:40,184 --> 00:23:41,936
My father was a failed novelist.

600
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:44,980
My mother was the heiress to
the Sugarman sugar cubes fortune,

601
00:23:45,064 --> 00:23:46,441
and my dad resented her for it.

602
00:23:46,523 --> 00:23:48,109
He used to make me cry with him

603
00:23:48,192 --> 00:23:49,902
while listening to Cole Porter records.

604
00:23:49,985 --> 00:23:51,862
He made me build my own tree house,

605
00:23:51,946 --> 00:23:53,697
and then he tore it down
while I was at summer camp

606
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:55,616
because instead of hearty, Christian nails,

607
00:23:55,699 --> 00:23:59,912
I used screws, which he
called fancy Jew nails.

608
00:23:59,995 --> 00:24:02,998
Like I said, totally normal.
