1
00:00:07,663 --> 00:00:09,553
Son, did you do your homework?

2
00:00:09,663 --> 00:00:11,763
I don't wanna do my homework!

3
00:00:11,873 --> 00:00:13,553
What, what, what?

4
00:00:13,673 --> 00:00:16,023
- I want Chicken 4 Dayz!

Over at Chicken 4 Dayz,

13
00:00:34,943 --> 00:00:36,963
they pump their
chickens full of hormones

14
00:00:36,983 --> 00:00:40,333
and keep them cooped up in tiny cages.

15
00:00:40,403 --> 00:00:43,383
Now, as a chicken, this concerns me.

16
00:00:43,413 --> 00:00:46,263
Here at Gentle Farms, we treat
our livestock differently.

17
00:00:46,283 --> 00:00:48,303
Lush fields, plenty of dignity,

18
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,773
and Foosball.

19
00:00:50,793 --> 00:00:53,273
The chickens here have wonderful lives

20
00:00:53,293 --> 00:00:55,973
before we harvest them,
so you can eat them.

21
00:00:56,003 --> 00:00:58,353
But wait, Pa, aren't we chickens?

22
00:00:58,383 --> 00:00:59,903
I don't wanna get eaten!

23
00:00:59,923 --> 00:01:01,983
Boy, these animals aren't like us.

24
00:01:02,013 --> 00:01:03,913
They're specifically bred to be eaten,

25
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:07,533
and genetically modified
for maximum flavor.

26
00:01:07,723 --> 00:01:11,033
When our chicks first hatch,
we lovingly inject them

27
00:01:11,103 --> 00:01:13,663
with natural delicious hormones,

28
00:01:13,693 --> 00:01:17,753
which makes them meat, thereby
erasing any moral gray area!

29
00:01:17,823 --> 00:01:20,003
Now you can feel good
about eating our meat.

30
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:24,183
It's simple: No one knows
chicken like chickens.

31
00:01:24,453 --> 00:01:25,683
Gentle Farms.

32
00:01:26,663 --> 00:01:30,603
Why put the "Skip Ad" button so late?
I'm not skipping now. I'm invested.

33
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:33,233
BoJack, you're driving a car right now.

34
00:01:33,253 --> 00:01:34,792
- Oh, right!
- Aah! Oh!

35
00:01:34,793 --> 00:01:36,132
Whoa!

36
00:02:54,503 --> 00:02:56,353
Kelsey, ray of sunshine.

37
00:02:56,463 --> 00:02:58,523
And who's this little drop of Jupiter?

38
00:02:58,623 --> 00:03:01,723
- This is my daughter, Irving.
- Your daughter's name is Irving?

39
00:03:01,753 --> 00:03:03,563
Gender-normative names are oppressive.

40
00:03:03,593 --> 00:03:05,403
Well, aren't you a little princess?

41
00:03:05,423 --> 00:03:07,393
What are you doing
outside of the castle?

42
00:03:07,433 --> 00:03:09,113
Mom, your friend is being weird.

43
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:11,233
BoJack is not my friend.

44
00:03:11,303 --> 00:03:13,693
- Whoa!
- Diane, I need you to handle Irving.

45
00:03:13,723 --> 00:03:16,243
- Handle her?
- It's Take Your Daughter To Work Day.

46
00:03:16,273 --> 00:03:18,543
I took my daughter to
work, she got empowered,

47
00:03:18,693 --> 00:03:21,633
and now I need you to take
my daughter away from work,

48
00:03:21,653 --> 00:03:23,133
so I can actually do some.

49
00:03:23,153 --> 00:03:25,093
Mom, don't pawn me off
onto your assistant.

50
00:03:25,113 --> 00:03:26,883
Can you not fight me on this, please?

51
00:03:26,903 --> 00:03:30,503
Take my car and my daughter,
and go do whatever it is you do.

52
00:03:30,623 --> 00:03:32,893
Way to delegate, captain! Down low!

53
00:03:32,993 --> 00:03:35,173
Nope? Look down. Just
put your eyes down.

54
00:03:35,293 --> 00:03:37,523
My hand is below your eye line. No?

55
00:03:37,543 --> 00:03:39,693
I guess you're stuck with me, kiddo.

56
00:03:39,793 --> 00:03:43,363
Sounds great, old-woman-o.

57
00:03:44,343 --> 00:03:46,573
What is it, BoJack? I'm
at my dumb niece's wedding.

58
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,533
Not you, honey! A different dumb niece.

59
00:03:49,593 --> 00:03:51,313
I feel like Kelsey doesn't like me.

60
00:03:51,343 --> 00:03:53,693
You're not really the
kind of person people like.

61
00:03:53,803 --> 00:03:56,073
- Right away?
- Uh, sure.

62
00:03:56,143 --> 00:03:58,253
But once they get to
know me, they adore me?

63
00:03:58,313 --> 00:03:59,963
How do I put this delicately? No.

64
00:04:00,103 --> 00:04:02,783
The problem is we haven't
gotten any one-on-one time.

65
00:04:02,853 --> 00:04:04,663
There are always other people around.

66
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:06,343
Filming me. Feeding me.

67
00:04:06,363 --> 00:04:08,053
Walking me to the garage at night,

68
00:04:08,073 --> 00:04:10,883
because one time I saw a bag
in the wind and I got spooked.

69
00:04:10,903 --> 00:04:13,333
BoJack, the only reason
you want Kelsey to like you

70
00:04:13,373 --> 00:04:15,053
is because she's cold and distant.

71
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,893
Any time someone tries to
love you, you shove them away.

72
00:04:17,913 --> 00:04:20,593
What? No, I don't,
stupid. You're stupid.

73
00:04:20,713 --> 00:04:22,813
Don't be such a dumb stupid idiot, Todd.

74
00:04:22,923 --> 00:04:25,773
Okay, I gotta go. Everyone's
staring at me for some reason.

75
00:04:25,883 --> 00:04:28,743
What? I'm ready. Let's take a picture.

76
00:04:29,843 --> 00:04:31,743
Hear ye! Hear ye!

77
00:04:31,843 --> 00:04:35,443
I call this meeting of
P.B. Livin' to order.

78
00:04:35,553 --> 00:04:38,363
I believe it was Benjamin
Franklin who said:

79
00:04:38,473 --> 00:04:41,073
"You have reached the end
of your free trial membership

80
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:43,373
at Benjamin-Franklin-Quotes.com."

81
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,003
- What a wise man.
- What's on the agenda, my frienda?

82
00:04:46,023 --> 00:04:48,123
Well, here's an idea.

83
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:51,793
What if there was a West Dakota?

84
00:04:51,903 --> 00:04:54,673
Todd, isn't that a job
for the State Department?

85
00:04:54,783 --> 00:04:56,883
Well, I got a whole page of other ideas,

86
00:04:56,993 --> 00:05:00,423
each as impractical as they
are prohibitively expensive.

87
00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:01,673
You know what they say:

88
00:05:01,713 --> 00:05:03,523
"You gotta spend money to make money."

89
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,893
So, how can I spend a lot of money?

90
00:05:06,003 --> 00:05:07,393
I know. I'll take a spa day.

91
00:05:07,503 --> 00:05:09,523
- Uh...
- Eyes, prepare to receive cucumbers.

92
00:05:09,553 --> 00:05:11,802
- We're in a meeting.
- You know what they say:

93
00:05:11,803 --> 00:05:14,913
"You gotta skip meetings
to have meetings." See ya.

94
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:17,373
- Wait, what should I do?
- I don't know.

95
00:05:17,473 --> 00:05:20,533
Oh, maybe you could go on one
of your silly Todd adventures.

96
00:05:20,643 --> 00:05:23,352
You know, whatever you do when
everyone is busy with other stuff.

97
00:05:23,353 --> 00:05:25,573
Okay.

98
00:05:27,023 --> 00:05:28,413
What is it, Todd?

99
00:05:28,443 --> 00:05:30,383
Princess Carolyn, I
need something to do.

100
00:05:30,403 --> 00:05:32,713
A job, or a task, or
a direction in life...

101
00:05:32,743 --> 00:05:34,933
You're my agent. Can
you give my life meaning?

102
00:05:34,953 --> 00:05:36,513
I don't have time for this.

103
00:05:37,123 --> 00:05:39,393
Well, don't stop on my account.

104
00:05:39,453 --> 00:05:41,923
Princess Carolyn, do I have a purpose?

105
00:05:42,003 --> 00:05:44,143
Oh, purpose? Are you high?

106
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:45,693
Only the normal amount.

107
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:48,113
I gotta go. They're about
to step on the glass.

108
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:50,443
Just stay out of trouble.

109
00:05:52,093 --> 00:05:54,613
Uh, okay.

110
00:05:58,433 --> 00:06:00,793
What I want is a hard target search

111
00:06:00,813 --> 00:06:04,543
of every gas station, backyard,
outhouse, pool house...

112
00:06:04,563 --> 00:06:06,503
And can I get a
black-and-white cookie,

113
00:06:06,603 --> 00:06:08,533
if it's not too G.D. troublesome?

114
00:06:08,653 --> 00:06:11,593
So, we know the chicken
crossed the road.

115
00:06:13,153 --> 00:06:16,923
But the real mystery is why?

116
00:06:18,743 --> 00:06:20,843
So, what do you want
to be when you grow up?

117
00:06:20,953 --> 00:06:22,162
First I'm gonna go to Brown,

118
00:06:22,163 --> 00:06:24,063
- then I'm gonna go to Yale Law.
- Wow.

119
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,693
Then I'm gonna be the
youngest Supreme Court Justice.

120
00:06:26,793 --> 00:06:30,223
- That's great.
- Or, you know, something in marketing.

121
00:06:30,343 --> 00:06:31,773
Wow.

122
00:06:32,053 --> 00:06:33,983
Would you mind if we
stopped by my house?

123
00:06:34,013 --> 00:06:35,243
I have to do laundry.

124
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,743
So, you just, like, do laundry?
That's, like, your thing?

125
00:06:38,843 --> 00:06:41,153
Okay. This whole attitude
you're putting on?

126
00:06:41,263 --> 00:06:42,483
I must be Shania Twain,

127
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:44,333
because that don't impress me much.

128
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:46,363
Is that a reference from the '90s?

129
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:48,883
You know that was 20 years ago, right?

130
00:06:49,023 --> 00:06:52,043
Hey, I was just like you
when I was a teenager.

131
00:06:52,153 --> 00:06:54,423
I was this badass overachiever

132
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:56,883
that had these big plans
to change the world.

133
00:06:56,993 --> 00:06:59,183
Yeah? What happened?

134
00:06:59,283 --> 00:07:02,843
Oh, you didn't hear?
I changed the world.

135
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,443
Did you have a nice shower?

136
00:07:09,543 --> 00:07:12,643
I made you a sandwich. Oh,
but it has turkey in it.

137
00:07:12,713 --> 00:07:13,672
Is that kind of weird?

138
00:07:15,463 --> 00:07:16,552
Police!

139
00:07:18,513 --> 00:07:19,953
Oh, man.

140
00:07:20,683 --> 00:07:22,833
What seems to be the
problem, Officer...?

141
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:25,663
Fuzzyface. Meow Meow Fuzzyface.

142
00:07:25,683 --> 00:07:27,993
A Chicken 4 Dayz
chicken fell off a truck,

143
00:07:28,023 --> 00:07:30,713
and I gotta find her and take
her to the slaughterhouse.

144
00:07:30,773 --> 00:07:32,913
You haven't seen any
chickens running around?

145
00:07:33,023 --> 00:07:34,373
No, I don't think so.

146
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:40,612
- Who's this?
- Uh, this is my, uh... My wife...

147
00:07:40,613 --> 00:07:43,173
Becca! Yeah, my wife Becca.

148
00:07:43,283 --> 00:07:45,463
- Becca Chavez. There she is.
- Okay.

149
00:07:45,543 --> 00:07:47,733
Yep, she loves her books.

150
00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:49,233
Big reader.

151
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,843
Real nerd.

152
00:07:50,963 --> 00:07:53,653
Back off? Okay, I'm sorry, honey.

153
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:56,063
Hold on, if you're really a nerd,

154
00:07:56,173 --> 00:07:58,313
who's your favorite Baroque composer?

155
00:07:59,883 --> 00:08:02,653
Bach? Not Vivaldi? You're insane!

156
00:08:02,763 --> 00:08:04,573
Yes, I am holding a Bic pen,

157
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:07,062
but I don't see how that's
relevant, Mrs. Chavez.

158
00:08:07,063 --> 00:08:08,812
Sorry. Becca.

159
00:08:08,813 --> 00:08:11,923
She's a charming woman.

160
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:15,503
I do have to look around a little
bit, just so I can say I did my job.

161
00:08:15,653 --> 00:08:18,593
- Uh, don't you need a warrant?
- Only if you're guilty.

162
00:08:23,913 --> 00:08:27,492
Well, in that case, mi casa es su casa.

163
00:08:31,963 --> 00:08:34,153
So, if anyone asks, you
were born in La Jolla.

164
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:36,183
You majored in Communications at USC,

165
00:08:36,293 --> 00:08:38,262
and now you're the booking agent

166
00:08:38,263 --> 00:08:39,842
for Kings of Leon.

167
00:08:39,843 --> 00:08:42,573
- Fine, you also book Beck.
- Todd?

168
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:44,653
Aah! I didn't find that
thing in your drawer!

169
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:46,663
Why are the police outside?

170
00:08:46,683 --> 00:08:49,953
Okay. I met this chicken and she
escaped from Chicken 4 Dayz factory,

171
00:08:49,983 --> 00:08:51,442
and she doesn't speak English,

172
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:54,192
but she's my best friend and
the cops are looking for her,

173
00:08:54,193 --> 00:08:56,003
and Mr. Peanutbutter went to the spa,

174
00:08:56,023 --> 00:08:58,743
and I love her, and her
name is Becca. Chickenson.

175
00:08:58,863 --> 00:09:01,473
- Todd, breathe.
- But we can't send Becca back.

176
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:04,473
They're gonna pump her full of hormones.

177
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:07,103
More hormones.

178
00:09:07,203 --> 00:09:09,683
I have a plan, but we gotta
get her out of here now.

179
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:13,292
- Todd, no. Becca doesn't belong to you.
- But she needs our help.

180
00:09:13,293 --> 00:09:15,332
Do you know how much
trouble we'd get in?

181
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,353
There's a policeman in our front yard.

182
00:09:17,463 --> 00:09:20,103
Uh-oh, here comes the
responsible suburban housewife.

183
00:09:20,213 --> 00:09:22,433
Gonna do whatever the man says.

184
00:09:24,183 --> 00:09:26,283
You're right. Let's get out of here.

185
00:09:26,303 --> 00:09:30,113
So, now you're just gonna do
whatever a teenage girl says?

186
00:09:30,143 --> 00:09:32,373
Jeezy kableezy, grow a spine.

187
00:09:32,393 --> 00:09:33,913
Yeah, or a backbone.

188
00:09:33,943 --> 00:09:35,022
Thank you, Becca.

189
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:40,413
Here chicken, chicken, chicken.

190
00:09:41,403 --> 00:09:43,963
Oh, oh. Well, we're off to the beach.

191
00:09:44,073 --> 00:09:47,393
Just me and my wife, and our
teenage daughter and our maid.

192
00:09:47,493 --> 00:09:50,213
- What? Why am I a maid?
- Silence, maid!

193
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,542
Honey, do you want to sit
in the front or the back?

194
00:09:52,543 --> 00:09:55,813
And why not? Maid, you can drive.

195
00:09:55,923 --> 00:09:58,733
Hope there's not too
much traffic on the 134.

196
00:09:58,843 --> 00:10:00,523
Okay, bye-bye, officer.

197
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,113
So long. Have a great day.

198
00:10:03,213 --> 00:10:06,233
Wait a second. The 134
doesn't go to the beach.

199
00:10:06,343 --> 00:10:07,983
Unless you took it to the 10.

200
00:10:08,093 --> 00:10:10,863
But then why wouldn't you
take the 405 to the 10?

201
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:13,033
Hold on, this pen isn't a Bic.

202
00:10:13,143 --> 00:10:15,823
No, no, this doesn't add up at all.

203
00:10:15,943 --> 00:10:19,003
Wait! That man's wife was a...

204
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:22,633
chicken!

205
00:10:24,113 --> 00:10:27,593
Fowl run afoul. A funky
chicken has flown the coop,

206
00:10:27,613 --> 00:10:30,843
and for a concerned
populace, the sky is falling.

207
00:10:30,953 --> 00:10:33,133
Michael Morgan, Chicken 4 Dayz CEO,

208
00:10:33,243 --> 00:10:36,843
this is a public safety hazard,
and your company is responsible.

209
00:10:36,963 --> 00:10:39,813
Admit it, you counted your
chickens before they hatched,

210
00:10:39,923 --> 00:10:42,443
and now, those chickens
have come home to roost.

211
00:10:42,553 --> 00:10:45,823
Tom, I want to take full
responsibility for this mishap.

212
00:10:45,883 --> 00:10:48,193
That's why, for a
limited time, everybody,

213
00:10:48,303 --> 00:10:52,783
we are offering our special
Full Responsibility Poppers

214
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:55,793
at participating
restaurants for only $4.99.

215
00:10:55,813 --> 00:10:57,232
Tell me, though, if one sees

216
00:10:57,233 --> 00:10:59,543
this delicious escaped
chicken in the street,

217
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:01,293
should they approach it, or...?

218
00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:04,673
Oh, no. I want to be very clear that
this is not like a friend chicken

219
00:11:04,693 --> 00:11:06,163
you see at school or work.

220
00:11:06,283 --> 00:11:08,263
This is a special kind of food chicken

221
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:10,843
that has lived its entire life indoors.

222
00:11:10,953 --> 00:11:13,563
This chicken is not socialized
for the outside world.

223
00:11:13,663 --> 00:11:16,643
Sounds like my ex-wife. Hey-yo!

224
00:11:16,663 --> 00:11:18,013
Oh, Tommy.

225
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:21,153
Look, the safest place for this
chicken right now is with us,

226
00:11:21,253 --> 00:11:23,563
so we can kill it,
turn it into a sludge,

227
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:26,533
and then press that sludge
into a delicious patty.

228
00:11:26,593 --> 00:11:28,743
I'd like to take this
moment to apologize

229
00:11:28,843 --> 00:11:31,153
for the earlier crack about my ex-wife.

230
00:11:31,263 --> 00:11:35,193
Shannon, we shared 14
beautiful years together.

231
00:11:35,313 --> 00:11:37,293
How do you respond to allegations

232
00:11:37,393 --> 00:11:40,703
that factory farming is
"torture," or "cruel,"

233
00:11:40,813 --> 00:11:44,373
or "like a terrifying movie about
some strange dystopian society,

234
00:11:44,443 --> 00:11:47,253
but in this monster story, the
horrifying monsters are us"?

235
00:11:47,283 --> 00:11:48,723
Relax, Tommy,

236
00:11:48,823 --> 00:11:52,853
everything we do is completely
legal and FDA-approved,

237
00:11:52,953 --> 00:11:55,103
so, therefore, it is fine.

238
00:11:55,203 --> 00:11:57,723
I have no follow-up questions.

239
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,393
- Okay, Todd, what's your plan?
- What?

240
00:12:02,503 --> 00:12:04,073
You said you had a plan.

241
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:07,073
Ask Diane for help.

242
00:12:07,173 --> 00:12:09,353
And now my plan has been completed.

243
00:12:09,513 --> 00:12:11,203
Nice follow-through, Todd.

244
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,073
We have a 'roided out chicken

245
00:12:13,103 --> 00:12:15,243
and the cops on the
lookout. What do we do?

246
00:12:15,263 --> 00:12:17,783
Hey, geniuses, why don't
we take her to Gentle Farms?

247
00:12:17,893 --> 00:12:21,323
Yeah, no one knows
chicken like chickens!

248
00:12:21,443 --> 00:12:24,593
They couldn't say that in
the ad if it wasn't true.

249
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:27,843
Yeah! Book Beck. You remember.

250
00:12:31,493 --> 00:12:34,433
- And cut! Company move to...
- Great news, blue-collar types.

251
00:12:34,493 --> 00:12:37,372
Instead of crew lunch
today, your star has arranged

252
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:39,773
for his favorite burrito
truck to bring you lunch.

253
00:12:39,873 --> 00:12:42,303
It's me, I'm that star!

254
00:12:43,883 --> 00:12:45,653
We're not breaking for lunch yet.

255
00:12:45,673 --> 00:12:47,233
Or we could break for lunch,

256
00:12:47,253 --> 00:12:49,313
and you and I could
get to know each other.

257
00:12:49,343 --> 00:12:50,693
The crew has more work to do.

258
00:12:50,723 --> 00:12:53,403
Once they've had a burrito, they'll
be off their circadian rhythm...

259
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,663
- What?
- Los Angeles P.D.

260
00:12:55,763 --> 00:12:57,863
Are you the owner of a 2002 Volvo

261
00:12:57,893 --> 00:12:59,982
with a "Reelect Al Gore" bumper sticker?

262
00:12:59,983 --> 00:13:01,623
As relevant today as it was then.

263
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:05,253
Are you aware said Volvo is currently
harboring a fugitive chicken,

264
00:13:05,363 --> 00:13:08,673
along with a teenage girl,
a small, sprite-like man,

265
00:13:08,823 --> 00:13:10,492
and a maid of some sort?

266
00:13:10,493 --> 00:13:12,973
That's my daughter! Not
the maid. The other one.

267
00:13:13,073 --> 00:13:15,583
I'd wager they're making
a run for Gentle Farms.

268
00:13:15,623 --> 00:13:17,103
Don't worry, though.

269
00:13:17,123 --> 00:13:19,933
We'll bring your daughter
home, dead or alive.

270
00:13:19,953 --> 00:13:22,133
- Alive! Alive!
- We're the L.A.P.D., ma'am.

271
00:13:22,163 --> 00:13:24,973
- We'll probably make the right call.
- Wait, wait, wait...

272
00:13:25,043 --> 00:13:26,553
All right, troops, listen up!

273
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,103
I'm ready to go after these
rabble-rousers with all...

274
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:31,903
Oh, no! Not until you get a warrant!

275
00:13:32,013 --> 00:13:33,453
Ah, damn it, I hate due process!

276
00:13:33,593 --> 00:13:35,733
You're a loose cannon,
Meow Meow Fuzzyface.

277
00:13:35,843 --> 00:13:39,023
No, I'm not. I'm a cannon,
maybe, but a loose cannon?

278
00:13:39,063 --> 00:13:40,543
Is that what you think of me?

279
00:13:40,563 --> 00:13:42,253
I think you play by your own rules.

280
00:13:42,273 --> 00:13:44,623
No way, he thinks rules
were made to be broken.

281
00:13:44,643 --> 00:13:47,192
These are all attributes
of a loose cannon.

282
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,173
No, I'm just a reckless renegade.

283
00:13:49,193 --> 00:13:51,253
- Sergeant Stone's a loose cannon.
- Aah!

284
00:13:51,403 --> 00:13:53,663
You shut your trap, Fuzzyface.

285
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:57,223
I'd say Stone's more of a cop
on the edge with nothing to lose.

286
00:13:57,323 --> 00:13:59,923
- That's a different thing.
- Now I'm just confused.

287
00:14:00,043 --> 00:14:02,473
Is Meow Meow Fuzzyface
a loose cannon or not?

288
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,393
All right, put on a pot of coffee.

289
00:14:04,503 --> 00:14:06,922
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.

290
00:14:08,423 --> 00:14:09,943
Aw, man.

291
00:14:10,003 --> 00:14:13,523
So full of burrito. Ooh.

292
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:15,363
Uh-oh, siesta time.

293
00:14:15,513 --> 00:14:18,993
I need to go. Irving ran off
with a fugitive chicken in my car.

294
00:14:19,013 --> 00:14:20,733
We can take my car. This is perfect.

295
00:14:20,763 --> 00:14:23,243
Why is this perfect? My
daughter could be in danger.

296
00:14:23,273 --> 00:14:26,543
Yes, I agree, but we can use the
car ride to get some one-on-one.

297
00:14:26,563 --> 00:14:28,453
I mean, who is BoJack?

298
00:14:28,563 --> 00:14:30,243
I'm sure I can find another ride.

299
00:14:30,363 --> 00:14:32,553
Every second you waste
finding another ride,

300
00:14:32,693 --> 00:14:36,503
your daughter gets closer to getting
her eyes poked out by a mutant chicken,

301
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:39,263
or worse, death, or slightly
better, teen pregnancy,

302
00:14:39,283 --> 00:14:41,003
or worse again, salmonella.

303
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:42,463
Okay, fine. Let's go.

304
00:14:42,493 --> 00:14:44,593
Yay! I'm calling this road trip the 007,

305
00:14:44,703 --> 00:14:46,223
because we are gonna bond.

306
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,933
Up top? Down low? Either one? Both?

307
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:52,462
Oh, wow, you guys have
a movie night here?

308
00:14:52,463 --> 00:14:55,393
- Oh...
- And we have 20 acres of pasture,

309
00:14:55,473 --> 00:14:58,033
where our chickens
have hours of free play.

310
00:14:58,053 --> 00:14:59,863
See, Todd? She'll be happy here.

311
00:14:59,893 --> 00:15:01,373
She sure will.

312
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:04,753
Because no one knows
chicken like chickens.

313
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:08,583
Thank you for saving this poultry
from a terrible life at a factory farm.

314
00:15:08,603 --> 00:15:09,783
You're a hero.

315
00:15:09,853 --> 00:15:12,743
But what if Chicken 4
Dayz tries to get her back?

316
00:15:12,863 --> 00:15:14,673
Don't you worry about your friend.

317
00:15:14,823 --> 00:15:17,433
- That chicken belongs to us now.
- Whoa!

318
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:20,593
- Where'd you get that gun?
- You mean originally, or just now?

319
00:15:20,703 --> 00:15:22,433
- Just now.
- It was in that barrel.

320
00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:25,013
- And what about originally?
- Also that barrel.

321
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:27,893
Look, Becca, I know this
is hard to understand,

322
00:15:28,003 --> 00:15:30,332
but I have to go, and
you can't come with me.

323
00:15:31,383 --> 00:15:34,323
No, no, you don't need
to book Beck anymore.

324
00:15:34,423 --> 00:15:36,533
Now you can just be a chicken.

325
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:39,353
See, this is where you belong, okay?

326
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:41,373
You hear me? I don't want you no more.

327
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,663
You weren't the best friend I ever had,

328
00:15:43,763 --> 00:15:47,743
and I never loved you! Now get, Becca!

329
00:15:47,853 --> 00:15:49,653
I said get!

330
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:57,133
She really stretched out that dress.

331
00:15:57,243 --> 00:15:59,473
She was so horrified,
she checked into rehab.

332
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:02,013
So, I'm kind of the reason
Drew Barrymore got sober.

333
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:04,633
Did you like Never Been
Kissed? If so, you're welcome.

334
00:16:04,703 --> 00:16:07,093
Can we have one conversation
that isn't about you?

335
00:16:07,163 --> 00:16:09,553
I don't understand why
you need me to like you.

336
00:16:09,663 --> 00:16:12,832
I don't need you to like me.
It would be fun if you liked me,

337
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,672
because I'd prove my parents
were wrong to never support me,

338
00:16:15,673 --> 00:16:18,302
because I earned the admiration
of an authority figure,

339
00:16:18,303 --> 00:16:19,743
proving I have intrinsic worth,

340
00:16:19,763 --> 00:16:21,823
but it's not a big
deal or anything. Jeez.

341
00:16:21,843 --> 00:16:25,153
Great story. You should put that
in a podcast, so I can unsubscribe.

342
00:16:25,183 --> 00:16:27,083
Can this piece of junk go any faster?

343
00:16:27,103 --> 00:16:29,732
It's been screwy since I hit
that deer a couple weeks back.

344
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:31,142
Probably should get it checked out.

345
00:16:36,773 --> 00:16:38,793
Probably should've
gotten it checked out.

346
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:45,423
- Those farmers seem nice.
- Yeah.

347
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:47,843
I think Becca will
be really happy there.

348
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:49,553
She'll have a nice life.

349
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,593
Yeah, until they kill her.

350
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:56,113
Well, yeah, but of all the places
that will eventually kill her,

351
00:16:56,213 --> 00:16:58,563
Gentle Farms seems like the best.

352
00:16:58,673 --> 00:17:00,393
This doesn't feel right.

353
00:17:00,473 --> 00:17:02,323
Becca was our friend.

354
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:05,222
- No. We gotta get her back.
- Uh, what do you mean?

355
00:17:05,223 --> 00:17:07,262
Remember when that guy
cocked his gun and said:

356
00:17:07,263 --> 00:17:08,903
"That chicken belongs to us now"?

357
00:17:08,973 --> 00:17:11,703
He wasn't doing that because
he likes cocking guns.

358
00:17:11,773 --> 00:17:14,923
- Then we'll just bust her out.
- Todd, there's nothing we can do.

359
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:16,593
Where else would Becca go?

360
00:17:16,693 --> 00:17:18,253
She doesn't even speak English.

361
00:17:18,323 --> 00:17:20,013
Well, we gotta do something.

362
00:17:20,033 --> 00:17:22,843
Look, I know I'm a screw-up
and all my ideas are terrible,

363
00:17:22,903 --> 00:17:26,673
but with Becca, I was
responsible for something.

364
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,492
I had a purpose.

365
00:17:28,493 --> 00:17:32,303
Ah. I guess you wouldn't understand.

366
00:17:36,793 --> 00:17:39,723
- Oh, my God, Diane!
- All right. Let's bust her out.

367
00:17:39,843 --> 00:17:42,573
Yes! Okay, and afterwards,
will you get me an iPad?

368
00:17:42,673 --> 00:17:45,603
- What? No.
- But I really want an iPad.

369
00:17:45,723 --> 00:17:48,533
Maybe you wouldn't understand.

370
00:17:48,553 --> 00:17:49,733
Don't push it.

371
00:17:51,683 --> 00:17:56,113
All right, all right, we've agreed.
He's a loose cannon, but he gets results.

372
00:17:56,153 --> 00:17:58,793
- I can live with that.
- Now, you go bust those perps.

373
00:17:58,823 --> 00:18:00,963
You'll need a maverick,
a by-the-book rookie,

374
00:18:00,983 --> 00:18:03,793
and a curmudgeonly veteran
one week from retirement.

375
00:18:03,953 --> 00:18:05,032
Go, go, go!

376
00:18:07,123 --> 00:18:10,563
We have received word that authorities
are now en route to Gentle Farms

377
00:18:10,663 --> 00:18:14,733
in an attempt to preempt the
pursued poultry at the pass.

378
00:18:14,753 --> 00:18:17,353
Do we have a graphic for
this? No? Where's the graphic?

379
00:18:17,383 --> 00:18:19,903
No, I'm not gonna go on
until we have a graphic.

380
00:18:20,003 --> 00:18:22,433
So, make one. I'll wait.
Yeah, hold on, America,

381
00:18:22,553 --> 00:18:24,783
Randy's gotta figure
out how to do his job.

382
00:18:24,883 --> 00:18:27,983
Because if I don't
have a graphic, Randy,

383
00:18:28,093 --> 00:18:29,863
people who are just tuning in...

384
00:18:29,893 --> 00:18:32,812
Why am I explaining this to you?
This is basic journalistic...

385
00:18:32,813 --> 00:18:36,213
I swear to God! We'll be right back!

386
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:42,463
Just got to place the jack
in the right jack apparatus.

387
00:18:42,483 --> 00:18:43,953
There, I have got...

388
00:18:43,993 --> 00:18:45,723
No. I have no idea what I'm doing.

389
00:18:45,783 --> 00:18:48,393
That was me acting. Pretty
convincing performance, huh?

390
00:18:48,413 --> 00:18:49,643
There's more to me...

391
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:51,643
Are you capable of experiencing a moment

392
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,372
that you don't then make about you?

393
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:55,162
What was your plan to get out of here?

394
00:18:55,163 --> 00:18:56,803
I don't know. Some hick will come by,

395
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,803
and I'll give him an
autograph for a tow.

396
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,473
Boom, his life's changed,
and you and I are on our way.

397
00:19:01,553 --> 00:19:05,033
Oh, my God. I'm going to
lose custody of my daughter.

398
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:07,393
The only reason I took
this movie is for her.

399
00:19:07,433 --> 00:19:09,592
This is my one shot
at a big studio movie.

400
00:19:09,593 --> 00:19:12,773
If I blow it, I'm back to making
small, critically acclaimed movies

401
00:19:12,813 --> 00:19:14,743
about lesbians learning how to recycle.

402
00:19:14,773 --> 00:19:16,833
You think I want to be an indie darling?

403
00:19:16,853 --> 00:19:18,703
Who's gonna fund Irving's education?

404
00:19:18,813 --> 00:19:22,743
- Marla? With her seasonal nut butters?
- Yeah, Marla sucks, right?

405
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:25,213
Indie-darling daughters
don't go to Brown, okay?

406
00:19:25,243 --> 00:19:28,263
They end up at cute pat-on-the-back
factories like Vassar,

407
00:19:28,323 --> 00:19:30,753
then move back in with
their indie-darling mothers

408
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:32,713
and make puppet shows
with their tampons,

409
00:19:32,743 --> 00:19:34,843
and they get a profile
in New York Magazine,

410
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,313
and the cycle continues.

411
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,643
Oh, my God, I'm a terrible mother.

412
00:19:38,753 --> 00:19:40,903
Hey, I know terrible mothers,

413
00:19:41,003 --> 00:19:43,653
and you're not a terrible mother.

414
00:19:43,753 --> 00:19:46,853
Hey, aren't you the
horse from Horsin' Around?

415
00:19:46,963 --> 00:19:48,092
And you're the director

416
00:19:48,093 --> 00:19:50,773
of Women Who Love Women
Who Love Recycling.

417
00:19:50,893 --> 00:19:53,783
Give you a lift in exchange
for a couple autographs.

418
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,833
There he is. Right on time.

419
00:20:00,693 --> 00:20:01,923
Shh, shh, shh.

420
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:04,553
Everyone keep quiet. We gotta...

421
00:20:04,653 --> 00:20:07,133
Ooh. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

422
00:20:13,373 --> 00:20:15,582
They probably didn't hear that.

423
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,773
Uh, that's probably a coincidence.

424
00:20:17,793 --> 00:20:19,733
Someone broke onto the farm!

425
00:20:19,753 --> 00:20:21,903
Maybe they're rehearsing a one-act play

426
00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:23,813
called Someone Broke Onto the Farm

427
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:25,592
and someone just said the titular line?

428
00:20:26,503 --> 00:20:27,552
This way.

429
00:20:27,553 --> 00:20:29,993
- Oh.
- Irving, this isn't safe.

430
00:20:30,013 --> 00:20:31,363
Get in the car, lock the doors.

431
00:20:31,383 --> 00:20:33,313
Don't be a badass and argue with me...

432
00:20:33,343 --> 00:20:34,892
- Yeah, okay, bye!
- Okay.

433
00:20:34,893 --> 00:20:37,083
Go, go, go!

434
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:39,253
Uh...

435
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:42,923
Becca?

436
00:20:44,403 --> 00:20:46,713
Who's making that ruckus
in my chicken coop?

437
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:51,003
- Becca, where are you?
- Becca, are you...?

438
00:20:51,153 --> 00:20:52,923
Becca?

439
00:20:53,243 --> 00:20:54,343
Is this you?

440
00:20:54,413 --> 00:20:56,433
Becca?

441
00:20:56,493 --> 00:21:00,173
To... To... Todd?

442
00:21:00,253 --> 00:21:02,693
Oh, I found her!
Diane! This one's Becca!

443
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:04,983
No! Todd! Don't you get it?

444
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,813
- They're all Becca.
- Oh.

445
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:10,243
Okay, go, chickens! You're free.

446
00:21:10,343 --> 00:21:11,653
Go, run to freedom!

447
00:21:11,763 --> 00:21:14,203
For generations they
will tell your story!

448
00:21:14,303 --> 00:21:16,573
- Who goes there?
- Oh, oh, oh, shit!

449
00:21:16,683 --> 00:21:18,333
- We gotta hide!
- Go, go, go!

450
00:21:19,313 --> 00:21:21,123
Hide, hide! In here! Someplace safe.

451
00:21:21,183 --> 00:21:23,203
Come on, come on. Oh, no!

452
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:30,873
- Shh, shh. Becca, no, no, no!
- Shh.

453
00:21:30,993 --> 00:21:34,093
Only we know how to care for
these creatures, you hear?

454
00:21:34,243 --> 00:21:38,702
Like I say: No one knows
chicken like chickens.

455
00:21:39,703 --> 00:21:41,013
Oh.

456
00:21:41,043 --> 00:21:44,853
- Diane, I'm sorry I got you into this.
- It's not your fault.

457
00:21:44,963 --> 00:21:47,233
I don't know why I always
get into these messes.

458
00:21:47,343 --> 00:21:50,113
You know, sometimes I
feel like my whole life

459
00:21:50,213 --> 00:21:53,603
is just a series of
loosely-related wacky misadventures.

460
00:21:53,723 --> 00:21:57,533
I think that's just what
being in your 20s is.

461
00:21:57,643 --> 00:21:59,283
- Really?
- Yeah.

462
00:21:59,393 --> 00:22:02,333
I'm supposed to be the adult
here, and I'm a total mess.

463
00:22:02,393 --> 00:22:04,613
You kidding? You're the
coolest person I know.

464
00:22:04,643 --> 00:22:06,812
- Really?
- Yeah. You always know what to do,

465
00:22:06,813 --> 00:22:08,583
and you don't take shit from anyone.

466
00:22:08,613 --> 00:22:10,043
Is that how you see me?

467
00:22:10,153 --> 00:22:13,013
Of course. You're like Lara Croft.

468
00:22:13,113 --> 00:22:15,383
In Diane's body.

469
00:22:18,993 --> 00:22:21,003
- This is our chance. Let's go!
- Come on!

470
00:22:21,043 --> 00:22:22,143
Go, go, go!

471
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,103
Please. Take me with you.

472
00:22:25,213 --> 00:22:27,563
I hate it here. I don't
want to kill chickens.

473
00:22:27,673 --> 00:22:30,823
I want to design video games
that help kids learn math.

474
00:22:30,843 --> 00:22:31,943
Oh...

475
00:22:32,003 --> 00:22:33,643
Whoa!

476
00:22:34,423 --> 00:22:36,353
I am so sorry.

477
00:22:36,473 --> 00:22:38,533
Okay, that was crazy! Just go.

478
00:22:38,643 --> 00:22:40,743
Let's get out of here!

479
00:22:46,273 --> 00:22:48,083
We're free, we're free! Oh, shit.

480
00:22:51,693 --> 00:22:55,003
Well, well, looks like
birds of a feather...

481
00:22:55,033 --> 00:22:56,383
go to jail.

482
00:22:56,403 --> 00:22:58,883
Why was he wearing sunglasses

483
00:22:58,913 --> 00:23:00,143
at night?

484
00:23:02,203 --> 00:23:05,133
I hope you folks like community service.

485
00:23:05,253 --> 00:23:07,353
- I do.
- What? Oh.

486
00:23:07,793 --> 00:23:09,792
Oh, my God, Irving,
thank God you're safe.

487
00:23:09,793 --> 00:23:11,223
Mom, I'm fine.

488
00:23:11,343 --> 00:23:13,693
Stop embarrassing me in
front of my cool friends.

489
00:23:13,803 --> 00:23:15,823
What? Cool?

490
00:23:15,883 --> 00:23:19,063
I mean, that's cool
that you think I'm cool.

491
00:23:19,183 --> 00:23:21,993
I don't care or anything,
but, you know, it's cool.

492
00:23:22,013 --> 00:23:24,222
Hey, this guy. What'd
you get arrested for?

493
00:23:24,223 --> 00:23:26,022
Being too cute?

494
00:23:26,023 --> 00:23:27,293
I want to be in his cell.

495
00:23:27,353 --> 00:23:28,482
Listen up, everybody.

496
00:23:28,483 --> 00:23:31,713
I, famous celebrity BoJack
Horseman, have an announcement.

497
00:23:31,773 --> 00:23:33,703
I'm going to ask you to drop all charges

498
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:35,663
on account of me being a celebrity.

499
00:23:35,693 --> 00:23:38,293
We gracefully accept the
requisite slap on the wrist

500
00:23:38,323 --> 00:23:40,503
and a brief, but
ultimately pointless, trial

501
00:23:40,573 --> 00:23:43,133
in the court of public
opinion. Good day.

502
00:23:43,163 --> 00:23:46,502
Well, you are famous, so
you are all free to go.

503
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:50,063
- But what about Becca?
- Took care of that, too.

504
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,973
Called in a favor with Drew Barrymore,

505
00:23:52,003 --> 00:23:54,813
and she'll pay off Chicken
4 Dayz to adopt your friend.

506
00:23:54,843 --> 00:23:57,882
Does she have a meadow that
Becca can frolic around in?

507
00:23:57,883 --> 00:24:00,642
You think Drew Barrymore
doesn't have a frolicking meadow?

508
00:24:00,643 --> 00:24:02,432
That is the dumbest thing I've heard.

509
00:24:02,433 --> 00:24:04,083
I learned something today.

510
00:24:04,183 --> 00:24:06,203
When you think something
isn't about you,

511
00:24:06,223 --> 00:24:09,113
you find a way to save the
day and realize that it was,

512
00:24:09,143 --> 00:24:11,482
all along, all about you.

513
00:24:12,653 --> 00:24:14,862
Plus, I got you all a burrito truck!

514
00:24:14,863 --> 00:24:17,093
- Hooray!
- Yay! I'm great!

515
00:24:20,823 --> 00:24:23,793
So, after all that, the
only thing that saved Becca

516
00:24:23,913 --> 00:24:26,183
was that BoJack was
friends with Drew Barrymore?

517
00:24:26,243 --> 00:24:28,803
- Yep.
- So, did anything we did matter?

518
00:24:28,913 --> 00:24:30,513
- Nope.
- I think it did.

519
00:24:30,963 --> 00:24:32,403
I think we made a difference.

520
00:24:32,503 --> 00:24:34,693
A small one, but a difference.

521
00:24:34,793 --> 00:24:37,103
Yeah, I think we did, too.

522
00:24:37,213 --> 00:24:40,443
I think we really changed
things for the better.

523
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:50,306
