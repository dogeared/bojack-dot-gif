Oh!

00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,156
All right, Beatrice,
you got a good whiff.

5
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,116
Now step away from
your father's breakfast

6
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,685
before he catches you a-sniffin'
and gives you a spankin'.

7
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:04,786
Yes, Mother.

8
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,831
Well, the photographer's
here. Where is Crackerjack?

9
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,584
He was aware that we're posing
for a family photo portrait.

10
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,502
I've got to ankle back to Indianapolis.

11
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,589
If the government is rationing
sugar, can't you ration work?

12
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,257
It is summer, after all.

13
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,633
Oh, that would be a dream,

14
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,052
but who else but I will
make sure the numbers add up

15
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:24,181
and compliment my secretary
on her tight sweaters?

16
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:28,018
We do appreciate the
sacrifices you make, Joseph.

17
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,979
Then after a long day of killing Nazis

18
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,273
we'll sit in a beer
garden and enjoy a pint.

19
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,192
All right, Crackerjack,
time's a-tickin'.

20
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,403
We need to take this portrait
before you and I both take a powder.

21
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,947
Sally, why don't you get
yourself some freezy pops,

22
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,908
and keep the change.

23
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,160
Aww, I want a freezy pop.

24
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,163
Oh, Beatrice, you know
iced cream is for boys.

25
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,927
You can sprinkle some sugar on a lemon.

26
00:04:49,928 --> 00:04:51,666
That's a good healthy girl snack.

27
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,168
Oh, all right.

28
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,463
Crackerjack, you look so
handsome in your soldier suit,

29
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,298
like a young Clark Gerbil.

30
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,218
Not now, you two.

31
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,887
Oh, we'll be as quick as

Oh, really? Time's arrow marches?

I didn't know arrows had legs.
"Look at me, I'm a marchin' arrow."

42
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,450
Honey Sugarman, how
did such a sweet face

43
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:36,086
end up with such a smart mouth?

44
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,463
I don't know, but I've got half a mind

45
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:42,342
- to kiss you with that smart mouth.
- Well, that half you can keep.

46
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,928
Oh! I almost forgot.

47
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,348
Say, if it isn't my old
baby blanket, Blinky.

48
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,016
I thought you could take it with you.

49
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,478
Mama, I don't need no Blinky
blankie to fight ninny Nazis.

50
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,147
Bea, will you hold on to it for me?

51
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,524
- Me?
- That's right.

52
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,776
I'll fight better if I
know Blinky's safe with you.

53
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,319
Ohh.

54
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,238
All right, folks, this is for posterity,

55
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,574
so don't forget to look far away sad.

56
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,147
Hey, I'm Tamara, that's Tamera.

57
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,816
- Hey.
- I don't need any help, thanks.

58
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,860
- Are you...
- Ryan Gosling? No.

59
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,738
- I get that all the time, it's...
- No, BoJack Horseman.

60
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:48,199
- No, sorry.
- See? That guy's way too fat to be BoJack.

61
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:52,454
- I'm not too fat to be BoJack.
- Yeah, BoJack is much fatter, right?

62
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,832
- No, BoJack is not fatter.
- So you're fatter?

63
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,668
- No! We are both equally not fat.
- Right.

64
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:02,213
You know who looks like BoJack
Horseman? Phil the stock boy.

65
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,758
Yeah, I see it.

66
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,302
Are you kidding me? He
looks nothing like me...

67
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,179
Meester Horseman.

68
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,848
So you were with Sarah
Lynn when she died, right?

69
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,017
- No.
- TMZ said you took her to the hospital.

70
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,977
- And you held her hand.
- Did you cry?

71
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,854
- I'm not...
- Did she totally poop her pants?

72
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,190
I heard people poop
their pants when they die.

73
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,650
- Listen to me...
- God, is that true?

74
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:26,321
Because I just read Romeo and Juliet
and that totally changes things.

75
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,910
All right! Ow!

76
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,745
No!

77
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:40,961
Ohhh!

78
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,548
Hey, Not BoJack, did
you hear they're making

79
00:07:56,549 --> 00:07:57,894
a miniseries about Sarah Lynn?

80
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,480
- BoJack is being played by Paul Giamatti.
- What?!

81
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,328
Why would you get Paul
Giamatti to play me...

82
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:04,985
meaty roles like that one?

83
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,781
Hey, buddy, is any of
that to fix the door?

84
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,366
- What do you care?
- I don't.

85
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,672
And if it were up to me,

86
00:08:12,673 --> 00:08:14,869
that old house would've
been torn down years ago.

87
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,413
It's a blight on the neighborhood.

88
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:20,625
And that broken door is the cherry
on the top of the shit sandwich.

89
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,669
What kind of a sandwich
has cherries on top?

90
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,339
A shitty one. How about fixing
your door instead of my metaphor?

91
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,138
Ow!

92
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,562
Oh, darling, don't lift that.
You'll rupture your uterus.

93
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,897
I'm sad to leave the summer house.

94
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:46,860
Well, it'll always be here,
just like polio and blackface.

95
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,662
Hey, we got a saying in Michigan:

96
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,190
"Put your damn door back on

97
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:01,458
or you're gonna freeze to
death, you stupid horse!"

98
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,585
- Hey, what's your name?
- Eddie.

99
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,296
Eddie, why don't you mind
your goddamn business?

100
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,402
Tell me, Doc, is she gonna be okay?

101
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,072
I know it's here somewhere.

102
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:35,492
Darling, we've been over this.
He doesn't need his blanket.

103
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,494
- Nothing we could do.
- I need to find it.

104
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,162
- He should've had it.
- She's dead?

105
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,233
He's gone, honey.

106
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,957
Even Blinky couldn't have
stopped that Nazi's bullet.

107
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,918
Oh, Joseph, I failed him.

108
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,378
Oh, Doc, I let her down.

109
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,882
This was bound to happen.
That's just show business.

110
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:54,219
That's just war, honey.

111
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,637
Here it is, Mother.

112
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,972
I put it in the closet for safekeeping.

113
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,100
- I never should have let him go.
- Honey, no.

114
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:03,770
If anyone's to blame, it's the
Jews for peeving off Hitler so bad.

122
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,017
Hey, did you fix my door?

That is a dick move, buddy!

00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,325
Hey! Stop fixing my door, asshole!

127
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,661
Why did you fix this so good?

128
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,705
If you keep breaking
it, I'm gonna break you.

129
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,791
Well, call me a Kit Kat bar
because I'm already broken.

130
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:10,211
Kit Kats aren't already
broken. That's the whole point.

131
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,005
What the hell?

132
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:16,718
Do you even know how to... anything?

133
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,470
I plastered this wall, didn't
I? Uh... oh... oh, oh...

134
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:22,265
I believe something got plastered.

135
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,100
The problem is I can't
get the right supplies

136
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,644
because the girls at the
hardware store are so annoying.

137
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:30,023
Heh! You're telling me! Tamera
and Tamara are the worst.

138
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,902
Yeah. "Hey, Tamara, how about
you get some manners ta-day?"

139
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:36,863
Let me get my toolkit.

140
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,656
Yeah, fine, you can help, a little.

141
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,159
If it means so much to
you, I will let you help me.

142
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,444
Oh.

143
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,293
How come you don't go away
for winter like everyone else?

144
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,920
- I don't fly.
- Okay.

145
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,964
- So, like, in an airplane, then?
- I don't fly.

146
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,591
You don't have to fly the plane.

147
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,344
They got this new thing now,
it's called being a passenger.

148
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,472
I have to ask, are you...

149
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,183
- BoJack Horseman? No.
- What? Who's BoJack Horseman?

150
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,436
Who's BoJack Horseman? He's a
very famous TV and film star.

151
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,394
Or he was, yeah,
before he gave it all up

152
00:12:11,395 --> 00:12:13,942
for a life of quiet anonymity.

153
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,652
Where is he? Nobody knows.

154
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,904
Perhaps a small town just like this one.

155
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,657
Perhaps he's even... in this very room.

156
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,576
But he's not, 'cause
I'm not BoJack Horseman.

157
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,286
Okay.

158
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:30,959
What I was going to ask was if you
were related to Joseph Sugarman,

159
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,794
or if you were just
squattin' in his house?

160
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,630
My grandfather. I used to come here
in the summers when I was a kid.

161
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:39,634
Hasn't got much use in the last
25 years, except for the termites.

162
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,428
Get on out of here, Bobby
and Susan! I saw you gnawin'!

163
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,097
Yeah, well, there isn't any more of us.

164
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,431
I'm the last of my line.

165
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,600
Once my mother dies
and I die that'll be it,

166
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,519
which is probably for the best.

167
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,813
No more of you?

168
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,690
- That'll be great.
- Oh, thank you.

169
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,483
That was the reaction I was going for.

170
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,258
I guess that's it.

171
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,635
Have a nice life, Hambone.

172
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,888
- Why'd you call me Hambone?
- You told me that's your name:

173
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,598
Hambone Fake-name-ington.

174
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,642
Oh, right, right, right, right, right.

175
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,820
This is the first summer
we'll spend here without him.

176
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,905
Yes, I suppose that's true.

177
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:46,325
But, as they say, time's
arrow marches forward.

178
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,537
You hear that, honey?
Time's arrow marches.

179
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,210
Ohh...

180
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,714
Well, I'd love to stay,
but I must be going.

181
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,174
As a modern American man

182
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,010
I am woefully unprepared to
manage a woman's emotions.

183
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,471
I was never taught,
and I will not learn.

184
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,680
Take care, you two.

185
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,856
Huh.

186
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:19,554
Look at this.

187
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,362
Yes, you have a very attractive mother.

188
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,989
What? No. Why would I...? Forget that.

189
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,741
- Look at that weather vane.
- Ah.

190
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,242
The house isn't finished yet.

191
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,328
We can't stop till we
find that weather vane.

192
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,580
Ooh! I know where this is.

193
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,542
Oh. Uh, all right.

194
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,127
Oh, lordy.

195
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,508
A bit more... is that it?

196
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,468
Oh, yeah, that's right.

197
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,220
Oh.

198
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,893
- Hey, there it is!
- Oh, hey! You can't be in here!

199
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,118
Why'd you say you can't fly?

200
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:56,979
Who's that other person
you're clearly in love with?

201
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,315
I never said I can't
fly, I said I don't fly.

202
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,193
If you want help with that weather
vane you'll clam up, Hambone!

203
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,113
Fine. Keep your stupid secret
about your clearly dead wife

204
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,698
and your probably-related dumb
fear of flying. See if I care.

205
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,500
What are those fireworks for, Mother?

206
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,252
Those are because the war is over.

207
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,004
We've dropped bombs on Japan
and now everyone is happy.

208
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:26,134
- Shouldn't we be celebrating?
- Yes. Yes!

209
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:29,262
Let's paint the town
scarlet, crimson, and ruby!

210
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,653
Why, I've got half a mind
to paint things redder

211
00:15:31,654 --> 00:15:32,932
than the banks of Normandy!

212
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,268
Ha ha! What? Too soon?

213
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:43,901
The Crab Brothers who run this
place are total scavengers.

214
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,195
If it can be pinched, they'll pilfer it.

215
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,489
Ooh! It's still there!

216
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:49,983
I'll make a distraction at the piano,

217
00:15:49,984 --> 00:15:51,701
you climb up, get the weather vane.

218
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,495
Oh, of course, the twelve
hundred... pound horse

219
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,956
will shimmy up a drain pipe to
get it, that makes more sense

220
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,625
than the dragonfly, who has the
word "fly" in the name of what he is.

221
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,196
Okay, all right, so you've gone now.

222
00:16:01,197 --> 00:16:02,753
You walked away, while I make my point.

223
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,423
- Mother, can I get a freezy pop?
- Sure, darling.

224
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,259
- You can have whatever you want.
- Attention, everyone!

225
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,803
I'm gonna play a song
now, so look at me!

226
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,264
Do not look up at the roof of that barn!

227
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,308

Ahh!

249
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,565
Sal! Oh, Sally!

250
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,609
- Oh! Mrs. Sugarman.
- What happened when he got shot?

251
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,486
Was it quick? Did he suffer?

252
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,114
Hey, Eddie, come on. Eddie, let's go!

253
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:57,243
- Hey! That's not yours!
- Yeah! We stole that fair and square.

254
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,371
- Mrs. S.
- Please, please tell me.

255
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,123
Please.

256
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,334
Mrs. Sugarman, control yourself.

257
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,836
Aaah!

258
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,344
Hey, gimme that!

259
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,972
- Please!
- Mother?

260
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,516
Why did everybody stop,
huh? What's the gag?

261
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,477
I want to dance. I want to fly!

262
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,649
Listen, you're sloshed
and making a scene.

263
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,569
Do the responsible thing: have one
more drink to steady your nerves

264
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,779
and then drive yourself and
your young daughter home.

265
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:36,157
Don't make me go back to
that quiet house, please.

266
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,826
- Mother, let's go.
- Eddie, let's go!

267
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:45,833
- Are you all right?
- It's okay. I'm okay.

268
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,878
My hands are doing the wiggly
doozle in three-four time, but...

269
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,963
Say, I got a swell idea.
Why don't you drive?

270
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,298
But I don't know how.

271
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,217
Why, it's only as easy as finding
a hobo in a barrel of beans.

272
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,970
It'll be grand. Everything
will be just grand.

273
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,181
Whoo!

274
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,058
Get back here!

275
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,103
Aaah!

276
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,147
Jeepers!

277
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,524
Yeah! We're hooligans!

278
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,194
Faster. I want to feel alive again.

279
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,529
I'd do anything to feel alive.

280
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:30,127
I gotta say, you really knew
how to handle those salad tongs

281
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,755
for someone who appears to
have never eaten a salad.

282
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,007
Yeah? Well, you got a nice set of pipes.

283
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,510
You're like a Josh Groban who
doesn't also think he's funny.

284
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:44,600
Okay, now, the house is
absolutely, totally finished.

285
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,103
Wow.

286
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,606
I wish I could somehow pay
you back for all your help.

287
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,316
Don't sweat it.

288
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,028
Hey, Eddie.

289
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,655
Whoa,
whoa-whoa-whoa!

290
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,573
- Ow!
- What are you doing?

291
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:00,950
What the hell'd you do that for?

292
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,244
I don't know, I thought
you would fly to save me

293
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,831
and by making you fly I would,
in a sense, be saving you!

294
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:10,960
How many times do I have
to tell you? I don't fly!

295
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,795
You're flying right now, asshole!

296
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:18,509
- Why'd you make me do that?
- You're welcome.

297
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,636
I haven't flown since Lorraine died,

298
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,513
and now you ruined it.

299
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:26,058
Okay. Obviously, this was not the
preferred outcome for either of us.

300
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,728
You want to fly? All right, let's fly.

301
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,313
- Oh, shit. No, I'm fine, actually.
- You want to go higher?

302
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,857
You want to see how high we can go?

303
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,512
Clearly, this is a sore subject.
I was wrong to bring it up.

304
00:20:35,513 --> 00:20:36,513
Let's go back down.

305
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,488
The night Lorraine died
she wanted to go back,

306
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,575
but I wanted to see
how high we could go.

307
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,743
Whoa! Plane! Look out!

308
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:44,916
You want to know how Lorraine felt

309
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:47,079
when she got sucked into that engine?

310
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,623
We're all just tiny bugs, right?

311
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,586
Aaaah!

312
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,229
Oh, God. No, no, come on.

313
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,106
Come on.

314
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,066
Are you insane?!

315
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,693
I don't want to live!

316
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,280
Why did you save me?

317
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,784
I don't want to live!

318
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,083
What were you thinking,
hoofing around the dance floor

319
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,585
like a motorized freckle?

320
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,588
- Did you snap your cap?
- You mustn't despise me, darling.

321
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,549
- Please.
- That's before mentioning poor Beatrice.

322
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,886
You aiming to get her killed
as well? She's all we got.

323
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,638
Oh, don't be cross with Mother!

324
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,097
I don't know what's wrong with me.

325
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,966
How am I supposed to sell sugar

326
00:21:48,967 --> 00:21:51,727
and keep my secretary's
self-esteem afloat

327
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:54,522
when you're having
honest-to-goodness fits of hysteria?

328
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,941
- Don't yell, Father.
- I just can't anymore.

329
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,901
I can't stop thinking about him.

330
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,946
I can't be with people
and I can't be alone.

331
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,948
I don't know how to be better, Joseph.

332
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,283
Please fix me. I want to be better.

333
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,085
BoJack? Where are you? Are you okay?

334
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,504
I don't know. I'm so sorry.

335
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,881
It's okay. Talk to me. What's going on?

336
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:23,300
It's Michigan, and it's beautiful here,

337
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,427
- and everything sucks.
- Michigan?

338
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,721
- BoJack, come home.
- I can't.

339
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,890
I don't belong there,
I don't belong anywhere.

340
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:33,143
But that's the thing, everybody
belongs in Los Angeles.

341
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:36,981
- There's, like, no barrier for entry.
- Oh, God, that's true.

342
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,732
They do let in just anybody.

343
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,116
I was at a coffee shop yesterday,

344
00:22:40,117 --> 00:22:41,944
I heard a guy trying to impress someone

345
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,405
by soft-pitching a web
series he crowdfunded.

346
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:48,367
Let me guess: the web series is about
how funny he and his friends are,

347
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,620
- just, like, hanging out.
- He described it as HBO's Girls

348
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,039
- but, like, from a guy's perspective.
- What?!

349
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:56,625
And he's just giving this
away for free in a coffee shop?

350
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,085
Somebody get this guy an overall!

351
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,087
Well, the important
thing is that barista's

352
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,381
definitely going to
have sex with him later.

353
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,302
I've missed you, Diane.

354
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,053
I've missed you, too.

355
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,600
Mmm.

356
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,604
- Is Mother okay?
- She is now.

357
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:19,982
She just let her womanly emotions
get the better of her, that's all.

358
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,484
Nothing a little operation couldn't fix.

359
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:23,694
Operation?

360
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,280
What's broken in the heart
can never be repaired,

361
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:30,075
but the brain, well, we have all
sorts of science for the brain.

362
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,997
She's a brand new woman now, and
she'd like to meet you very much.

363
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,838
- Mother?
- Oh, hello.

364
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,340
It's Beatrice.

365
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,426
Yes, that's right. What a pretty girl.

366
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,554
- What did they do to you?
- Oh, hush.

367
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:53,390
It's okay. I'm better now.

368
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,059
I don't understand.

369
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:58,812
Love does things to a
person, terrible things.

370
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:03,150
Beatrice, promise me
you'll never love anyone

371
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:07,237
- as much as I loved Crackerjack.
- I promise. I won't.

372
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:09,239
Why, I have half a mind...

373
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,416
Keep going, keep going, keep
going. There we go, big boy.

374
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,126
Hey, what's going on out here?

375
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,461
Probably should have warned you,

376
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,005
when these guys tear the house
down it might make some noise.

377
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,173
Tear the house down?!

378
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:29,635
Uh, yeah. You think I just want to
mope around in a shrine to the past,

379
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,721
getting off on my own guilt while
the rest of my life passes me by?

380
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:33,834
Pathetic, much?

381
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,642
But we spent the last eight
months restoring this place.

382
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,310
Yeah, and then you tried to kill me.

383
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:40,312
That's usually a series
wrap on a friendship.

384
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,815
- What is a series wrap?
- Are you serious?

385
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,526
Oh, my God, what am I doing
in this backwash of a town?

386
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,236
Do you even get Showtime here?

387
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,405
- So what was all this for?
- I don't know.

388
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,156
Guess it was just a big waste of time.

389
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,118
But you can't change the past.
Time's arrow marches on, right?

390
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,327
I don't believe this.

391
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:59,873
Well, as a great woman once
said, suck a dick, dumbshit.

392
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,751
- Where are you going?
- Home.
