1
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,862
Sir, you can't send me to Vietnam.

2
00:00:11,863 --> 00:00:13,697
I can do whatever I want.

3
00:00:13,698 --> 00:00:17,493
I'm president of the goddamn
United States of America.

4
00:00:17,494 --> 00:00:19,119
Isn't that right, Checkers?

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,473
That's what it says
on your business cards.

6
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:25,376
There are going to be riots
in the streets.

7
00:00:25,377 --> 00:00:26,793
I'm Secretariat.

8
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:29,004
You think I'm afraid
of a few rioting hippies?

9
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:31,941
Don't make me laugh. Ha-hoo.

10
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:34,051
Or whatever a laugh sounds like.

11
00:00:34,052 --> 00:00:35,886
Please, I'll do anything.

12
00:00:35,887 --> 00:00:38,055
You gotta send someone else
in my place.

13
00:00:38,056 --> 00:00:44,078
Hmm. Perhaps an arrangement can be...
arranged.

14
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:50,942
I'm just an athlete. I'm no hero.
My brother Jeffretariat is the hero.

15
00:00:50,943 --> 00:00:53,070
He's fighting the Reds over in 'Nam,

16
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:56,073
which is necessary
to protect our way of life.

17
00:00:56,074 --> 00:00:59,284
And another hero is President Nixon.

18
00:00:59,285 --> 00:01:02,722
He is one groovy dude.

19
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,100
Groovy.

20
00:01:09,712 --> 00:01:11,755
What the hell are you doing?

21
00:01:11,756 --> 00:01:12,940
Sorry, Mommy!

22
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:14,508
Don't you dare put that out.

23
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:18,596
That is a perfectly good cigarette,
and you are going to finish it.

24
00:01:18,597 --> 00:01:19,763
But I don't wanna.

25
00:01:19,764 --> 00:01:22,057
And I don't want to be
the mother of a quitter.

26
00:01:22,058 --> 00:01:23,767
Finish it.

27
00:01:25,061 --> 00:01:27,605
Jesus Christ, you can't even smoke
a cigarette right.

28
00:01:27,606 --> 00:01:30,982
Don't you dare cry,
don't you ever cry.

29
00:01:30,983 --> 00:01:32,150
You wanted this.

30
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:35,654
Are you punishing me for smoking
or for stealing?

31
00:01:35,655 --> 00:01:38,174
I'm punishing you for being alive.

32
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,930
Ugh.

33
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:48,041
Uh, BoJack? You really shouldn't throw
a lit cigarette off the...

34
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:51,730
Fine. I'll call 911.

35
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,395
The fire department got
everything under control,

36
00:02:50,396 --> 00:02:52,314
but the cable's out
for the neighborhood.

37
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:54,483
I don't understand
what started the fire.

38
00:02:54,484 --> 00:02:56,360
Nobody knows where fires come from,
it's a mystery.

39
00:02:56,361 --> 00:03:00,155
Anyway, I am fired up
about my first day back on set.

40
00:03:00,156 --> 00:03:02,073
We're gonna finish
that big Nixon scene.

41
00:03:02,074 --> 00:03:04,743
We were just one shot away
before we went on hiatus.

42
00:03:04,744 --> 00:03:06,828
Yeah, I know.
You told me at breakfast.

43
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:07,847
Why did you call me?

44
00:03:07,872 --> 00:03:09,789
Usually I talk to Diane
on the way to work,

45
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,710
but she abandoned me to teach piano
in Cordovia or something.

46
00:03:12,711 --> 00:03:16,296
Oh. Well, glad you settled for me
because Diane wasn't available.

47
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:19,275
You bet. Oh, man, I'm gonna kill
in this Nixon scene.

48
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,968
BoJack gonna be in "da" house.

49
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,696
In da White House.

50
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:27,558
What happened to da house set?
Da White House set?

51
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:29,976
- Things changed a little.
- You cut the Nixon scene?

52
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:32,270
The Nixon scene is the core
of the whole movie.

53
00:03:32,271 --> 00:03:34,773
Where we see Secretariat
be morally corrupted

54
00:03:34,774 --> 00:03:37,192
and get to look
into the real darkness of his soul.

55
00:03:37,193 --> 00:03:39,528
It's still all that,
except now it happens

56
00:03:39,529 --> 00:03:41,655
while you give a Christmas present
to your nieces

57
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:43,990
and they hug you
while your butt is stuck in a chimney.

58
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,784
Is one of the nieces Nixon?

59
00:03:45,785 --> 00:03:47,578
Over hiatus, we ran a focus group.

60
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:49,889
People don't want
all that controversial stuff.

61
00:03:49,914 --> 00:03:53,041
But we were supposed to make
a gritty movie about the real Secretariat.

62
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:55,711
- Warts and all.
- Kid, "warts and all" don't pay bubkes.

63
00:03:55,712 --> 00:03:58,213
That's why they took the gay stuff
out of A Beautiful Mind.

64
00:03:58,214 --> 00:04:00,382
Know that guy who spent 12 years
as a slave?

65
00:04:00,383 --> 00:04:03,361
They don't talk about the 60 years
he spent as a jerk.

66
00:04:03,386 --> 00:04:05,220
- Kelsey, you're okay with this?
- Eh...

67
00:04:05,221 --> 00:04:06,346
That's showbiz.

68
00:04:06,347 --> 00:04:08,932
See, BoJack,
that's the shrug of a pro who gets it.

69
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:10,660
Good shrugging, kid.

70
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:15,105
Yo! Care-to-the-O-to-the-Lyn-to-the...

71
00:04:15,106 --> 00:04:16,940
That's the end of your name.
We need to talk.

72
00:04:16,941 --> 00:04:19,443
We'll meet in the supply closet
in one minute. Break!

73
00:04:19,444 --> 00:04:20,795
Oh, okay.

74
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,404
Ooh, ow.

75
00:04:22,405 --> 00:04:26,408
Carolyn, when you're in the throes
of a very ugly divorce such as I am,

76
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:30,454
along with all that pain and degradation
comes a certain perfect clarity,

77
00:04:30,455 --> 00:04:35,626
and right now that clarity is telling me
that you and I should get out of here.

78
00:04:35,627 --> 00:04:38,128
Well, what do you mean,
"get out of here"?

79
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:42,716
Beautiful, I'm starting my own agency,
and I want you to be my partner in crime.

80
00:04:42,717 --> 00:04:44,903
What? But I can't just leave Vigor.

81
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,511
I've been here 20 years.

82
00:04:46,512 --> 00:04:48,096
Who's gonna water the plants?

83
00:04:48,097 --> 00:04:49,765
Um, I'm sorry. You water the plants?

84
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:51,391
I started doing it as an intern,

85
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:54,311
but then no one told me to stop,
so it's still kind of my job.

86
00:04:54,312 --> 00:04:56,980
Carolyn,
you are my gritty, witty city kitty.

87
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:59,065
I want you with me, fifty-fifty.

88
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,443
Things are so crazy
for me right now. I...

89
00:05:01,444 --> 00:05:05,196
Don't give me that, you want crazy.
"Crazy" is your favorite Patsy Cline song

90
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:07,365
and your second favorite
Gnarls Barkley song.

91
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:08,492
I don't want crazy.

92
00:05:08,493 --> 00:05:12,078
I've got five episodes
of The Good Wife piled up on my DVR,

93
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,581
and I just want a night off
to enjoy them.

94
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:18,460
Well, if that's how you feel, I guess
I could just go to Vanessa Gekko.

95
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:21,963
- Gekko?!
- But I'd rather look at you all day.

96
00:05:21,964 --> 00:05:25,944
You're an amazing agent.
And you're bright, and you're fun.

97
00:05:25,968 --> 00:05:29,596
And I think we could make something
really special.

98
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:32,850
We weren't doing anything!
We were just looking for closet supplies.

99
00:05:32,851 --> 00:05:36,311
Are you the person to talk to
about unclogging the toilet?

100
00:05:36,312 --> 00:05:37,855
Stuart, I'm your boss.

101
00:05:37,856 --> 00:05:41,065
Okay, but you're the one
in the janitor's closet, so...

102
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:43,586
What, I'm the idiot?

103
00:05:47,031 --> 00:05:49,616
The first thing you notice
about Sebastian St. Clair

104
00:05:49,617 --> 00:05:51,284
is that he speaks in paragraphs.

105
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:53,829
Even I can't believe
how much good we've done here,

106
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,413
and I'll believe almost anything.

107
00:05:55,414 --> 00:05:58,375
In the last six weeks,
we dug a new well, built a school,

108
00:05:58,376 --> 00:06:01,378
and next month
the community center is doing Seussical.

109
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:02,587
There we go.

110
00:06:02,588 --> 00:06:04,506
In his previous life,
Sebastian owned

111
00:06:04,507 --> 00:06:06,216
a chain of high-end department stores.

112
00:06:06,217 --> 00:06:07,986
I want to stock up on muffs.

113
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,489
We're going to sell a lot of muffs
this winter. Huzzah!

114
00:06:12,014 --> 00:06:14,683
Diane, I lived a life
of power and luxury,

115
00:06:14,684 --> 00:06:16,643
and then my picture
was in the newspaper.

116
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:18,436
- A real-life newspaper!
- Uh-huh.

117
00:06:18,437 --> 00:06:20,313
But I knew my life was empty.

118
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:23,316
At night I heard the cries
of children sick and dying.

119
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:25,109
And I would scream into the night.

120
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,696
Shut up! Shut up, children!

121
00:06:27,697 --> 00:06:30,657
But the phantom cries would not abate.

122
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:32,409
And so I began my travels,

123
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,912
with little more than a compass,
a yearning for adventure,

124
00:06:34,913 --> 00:06:36,788
and several crates full of unsold muffs.

125
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:40,166
I knew there were people out there
just waiting for my help.

126
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,210
Diane, this is Kinko.

127
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:43,378
I am Kinko.

128
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:44,796
In his language, it means,

129
00:06:44,797 --> 00:06:47,549
orphan whose parents were murdered
by rebels and will die young,

130
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,092
probably from malaria.

131
00:06:49,093 --> 00:06:50,778
Hi, Kinko. I'm Diane.

132
00:06:50,803 --> 00:06:53,555
It means,
my parents liked the show Cheers.

133
00:06:53,556 --> 00:06:57,935
Cheers! Oh, you're good.
You're very good.

134
00:06:57,936 --> 00:06:59,978
When Sebastian St. Clair says
you're good,

135
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:01,855
you want to believe
that you really are.

136
00:07:01,856 --> 00:07:05,483
That you, like Sebastian, are part
of something bigger than just yourself.

137
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:08,904
And for a moment,
you feel like you are.

138
00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:10,756
Oh, Kinko made a mess.

139
00:07:12,408 --> 00:07:17,287
Now I finally realize that a triple hug is
way more valuable than a Triple Crown.

140
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:19,330
And cut. Neat.

141
00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:21,475
- Let's break for lunch.
- Oh!

142
00:07:23,502 --> 00:07:24,878
Kelsey, this is a nightmare.

143
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,923
I had to touch three children today,
and one of them was sticky.

144
00:07:27,924 --> 00:07:30,258
Yeah, it was you.
Wash your damn hands, you gremlin.

145
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:33,112
- BoJack, there's nothing we can do.
- No, this isn't you.

146
00:07:33,137 --> 00:07:34,763
I've seen everything you've done.

147
00:07:34,764 --> 00:07:37,348
Your films are challenging and gritty,
and they're great.

148
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:39,726
I'm not just saying that
because they're full of lesbians.

149
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:42,228
Look, even if I wanted to finish
that Nixon scene,

150
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:44,355
we don't have an Oval Office set.

151
00:07:44,356 --> 00:07:46,357
There's one at the Nixon Library
in Yorba Linda.

152
00:07:46,358 --> 00:07:48,318
Why on earth do you know that?

153
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,695
In season three of Horsin' Around,
the horse got elected president

154
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:52,071
and we shot on location.

155
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:55,033
We can sneak into the library
and get the shot, guerilla-style.

156
00:07:55,034 --> 00:07:56,618
Once Turteltaub sees it,
he'll love it,

157
00:07:56,619 --> 00:07:59,179
and we can make the movie
we both want to make.

158
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:03,500
- Okay, I'm in. Let's do it.
- All right!

159
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:05,961
Did they really make
your character president?

160
00:08:05,962 --> 00:08:07,045
Only for season three.

161
00:08:07,046 --> 00:08:09,422
In season four, it turned out
it was all a dream.

162
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:11,675
They called my airplane Air Horse One.

163
00:08:11,676 --> 00:08:14,445
And the vice president was
a hip-hop zebra named Zebro.

164
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,304
- Come on.
- It wasn't our best season.

165
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:18,699
But on the bright side,
was not our worst.

166
00:08:19,183 --> 00:08:22,560
Step one, we go to the Nixon Library...

167
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:24,604
and steal the scale model.

168
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,773
Welcome to my library.

169
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:29,043
I'm Nixon..

170
00:08:29,735 --> 00:08:32,737
Yeah, you know,
some people say I look like Nixon.

171
00:08:32,738 --> 00:08:36,533
Not because he's my dad or anything.
That's crazy. Nixon's not my dad.

172
00:08:36,534 --> 00:08:40,119
But if you have any questions about Nixon,
I'd be happy to answer them.

173
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,706
Yeah, I have a question. Um...

174
00:08:42,707 --> 00:08:46,334
Is that the lighted exit sign
from Nixon's boyhood home?

175
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,170
Uh, no, that's just an exit sign.

176
00:08:49,171 --> 00:08:50,588
- Is that...
- Here we go.

177
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:53,758
...the handicapped drinking fountain
he used in the White House?

178
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,510
No, just a normal drinking fountain.

179
00:08:55,511 --> 00:08:56,695
- Hang on.
- One more.

180
00:08:56,721 --> 00:08:59,138
- Is that the smoke alarm...?
- No.

181
00:09:02,267 --> 00:09:04,978
So the Oval Office is right here,
next to the men's room.

182
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:08,065
I remember because season three
of Horsin' Around was a big cocaine year.

183
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:09,858
All the pressures of being president.

184
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:13,277
- I don't see how we'll pull this off.
- We're gonna need a crack team.

185
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:16,280
First, we gotta get
the best lock-pick in the city.

186
00:09:16,281 --> 00:09:18,867
- Not interested.
- Okay.

187
00:09:18,868 --> 00:09:20,744
The second best lock-pick in the city.

188
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:22,721
- No way I'm doing that.
- Got it.

189
00:09:22,747 --> 00:09:23,830
A lock-pick.

190
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:25,248
Todd, can you pick locks?

191
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:27,333
- Kind of.
- Great. You're in.

192
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,960
We'll need an expert cat burglar.

193
00:09:28,961 --> 00:09:31,254
All right, Good Wife,
let's see what you got.

194
00:09:31,255 --> 00:09:32,881
Hey, Princess Carolyn!

195
00:09:32,882 --> 00:09:35,675
Kelsey and I are gonna break
into the Nixon library

196
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:38,362
to steal a shot
for our Secretariat movie.

197
00:09:38,387 --> 00:09:43,349
It's a super-sneaky, kooky caper
that stands to benefit you in no way.

198
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,517
Are you in?

199
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:46,352
Hey! Shut up down there!

200
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:47,938
- You shut up!
- Make me!

201
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:50,440
Hey, you got a problem?
Take it up with my agent,

202
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:52,525
your downstairs neighbor
Princess Carolyn.

203
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:56,195
We'll need someone to play Checkers.

204
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:58,907
Hey, Chicago! Al Capone, deep dish.

205
00:09:58,908 --> 00:10:02,368
What does Ethan Hawke know?
We'll find out tonight. Da Bears.

206
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:04,121
BoJack, I'd love to help you out,

207
00:10:04,122 --> 00:10:05,956
but I'm super-busy recording promos

208
00:10:05,957 --> 00:10:08,166
for television's
highest-rated new game show.

209
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:11,377
- We can probably do it without you.
- This next one's for Seattle.

210
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:14,547
Hey, Seattle! Space Needle, Starbucks.

211
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:18,093
What does Ethan Hawke know?
We'll find out tonight. Rain.

212
00:10:18,094 --> 00:10:21,488
It's too bad though because I could
really bring a lot to this project.

213
00:10:21,513 --> 00:10:24,766
The more I think about it,
Checkers wouldn't even be in the shot.

214
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:26,434
It's just a single on Secretariat.

215
00:10:26,435 --> 00:10:30,354
Hey, Waco, Texas! Terrible tragedy.
What does Ethan Hawke know?

216
00:10:30,355 --> 00:10:33,817
- We'll find out tonight. So sorry.
- You know what? Forget I even asked.

217
00:10:33,818 --> 00:10:36,503
- Twist my arm, why don't you? I'll do it.
- Okay.

218
00:10:37,113 --> 00:10:39,114
Finally, we'll need a criminal mastermind.

219
00:10:39,115 --> 00:10:42,492
Character actress Margo Martindale,
you've been a model prisoner.

220
00:10:42,493 --> 00:10:44,285
I'm glad I served my time.

221
00:10:44,286 --> 00:10:46,346
But now I'm ready to move on with my life

222
00:10:46,371 --> 00:10:48,123
and get back to doing small roles

223
00:10:48,124 --> 00:10:50,768
in critically-acclaimed films
and television shows.

224
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:54,671
Watch, purse, lipstick,

225
00:10:54,672 --> 00:10:57,482
Emmy Award
for Best Guest Actress.

226
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:04,889
I need your help with a break-in.

227
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,892
BoJack, I've been out of prison
for two minutes.

228
00:11:07,893 --> 00:11:09,703
What took you so long?

229
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:16,317
Kelsey, Mr. Peanutbutter and I
are gonna break into the library.

230
00:11:16,318 --> 00:11:19,403
But the problem is,
the place is crawling with cops.

231
00:11:19,404 --> 00:11:20,822
They're on high alert

232
00:11:20,823 --> 00:11:24,075
because some idiot
stole this model last night.

233
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:26,410
Yeah, nice work, Todd.

234
00:11:26,411 --> 00:11:30,540
Who am I kidding?
I can't stay mad at you. You're adorable.

235
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:34,418
Look at your big saucer eyes.
I can go swimming in them!

236
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:36,963
- Totally.
- Now, we need to lose the cops.

237
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:38,882
The rest of you will create a diversion

238
00:11:38,883 --> 00:11:42,969
by breaking into the only other place
in Yorba Linda of cultural significance:

239
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,489
the Discount Fine Art Gallery
in the strip mall,

240
00:11:45,514 --> 00:11:47,891
between the tanning salon
and the adult bookstore.

241
00:11:47,892 --> 00:11:50,476
Once you set off the alarm,
all the cops will go there.

242
00:11:53,355 --> 00:11:57,234
Now, things could get ugly.
One of you is very likely to die.

243
00:11:57,235 --> 00:12:00,070
- Possibly Alan.
- Why possibly Alan?

244
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:02,321
Well, you are the guy
none of us knows that well.

245
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,157
I just came to fix your cable.

246
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:07,410
Alan, you already know too much.
You're a part of this now, like it or not.

247
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:09,954
- But...
- Hey, you think you could keep it down?

248
00:12:09,955 --> 00:12:12,874
I'm reading a script
and I'm having trouble focusing,

249
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,210
so now my notes are
gonna be confusing and vague.

250
00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:16,127
We're almost done.

251
00:12:16,128 --> 00:12:18,088
I know you're having fun
with your police cars,

252
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:21,465
I just wish you would have asked
before you invited these people over.

253
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:23,801
- I live here, too.
- You're right. I'm sorry.

254
00:12:23,802 --> 00:12:26,637
And can you at least let Alan
fix the cable before he dies?

255
00:12:26,638 --> 00:12:30,242
I can't die. I'm endangered!

256
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:33,853
"And the truffle-infused gnocchi
was the star dish

257
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:36,981
at this up-and-comer that will please
the pickiest of Brooklynites

258
00:12:36,982 --> 00:12:38,691
and the less discerning Staten Islander."

259
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:41,569
When I grow up, I can be food critic
for New Yorker?

260
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,696
You can do anything you want in life.

261
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:45,477
Not everyone can write for The New Yorker,

262
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,450
but there's always The Atlantic.

263
00:12:47,451 --> 00:12:48,826
Diane,

264
00:12:48,827 --> 00:12:52,330
I'm concerned you're spending
a lot of time with this sickly child.

265
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:55,458
Remember, you're supposed
to be writing about me.

266
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:58,295
Sure, but isn't this why we're here?
To help these people?

267
00:12:58,296 --> 00:13:00,255
I'm here to help these people.

268
00:13:00,256 --> 00:13:03,716
You're here to help me help them
by writing a book about me

269
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:06,928
so people back home will give money
to my foundation.

270
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:08,239
Great.

271
00:13:09,932 --> 00:13:13,911
Okay, come on. Over here. Get it.

272
00:13:16,814 --> 00:13:19,190
We're in. It's too late to turn back now.

273
00:13:19,191 --> 00:13:23,069
One of us isn't going
to come out of this alive.

274
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,862
Why do you all keep saying that?

275
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:28,283
Why can't we all assume we're gonna
make it out alive and go from there?

276
00:13:28,284 --> 00:13:31,786
Alan, we've got enough problems without
worrying about your imminent death.

277
00:13:31,787 --> 00:13:33,663
Can't we just all shut up and do this?

278
00:13:33,664 --> 00:13:37,041
Why does everything have to be
a big, complicated mess?

279
00:13:37,042 --> 00:13:39,169
Like,
look at this Thomas Kinkade painting.

280
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,628
It's simple.

281
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:44,299
And serene. And... pleasant.

282
00:13:47,386 --> 00:13:49,929
I think that the vest
makes me look kind of chunky.

283
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,325
I don't do CrossFit five days a week
to not look sweet in this uniform.

284
00:13:53,351 --> 00:13:56,311
I swear to God,
if you don't shut up about CrossFit...

285
00:13:56,312 --> 00:13:58,271
Break-in at the Discount

286
00:13:58,272 --> 00:13:59,897
Fine Art Gallery at the strip mall.

287
00:13:59,898 --> 00:14:03,609
Let's roll!
That's a thing we say at CrossFit.

288
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:21,752
Remember when my character
on Mr. Peanutbutter's House was

289
00:14:21,753 --> 00:14:25,006
- elected president?
- Let me guess, it was all a dream?

290
00:14:25,007 --> 00:14:27,258
No, I served half a term,
then resigned

291
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:29,510
because when Zachary
had a bad time with peer pressure,

292
00:14:29,511 --> 00:14:31,762
I realized I was spending
too much time being president

293
00:14:31,763 --> 00:14:33,491
and not enough time being a dad.

294
00:14:33,515 --> 00:14:35,451
It's like you didn't even watch my show.

295
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,186
Okay, I'd like you here.

296
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:40,438
And then you are going to be over here.

297
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:42,399
- Freeze!
- I'm union.

298
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,359
- Playing dead.
- Breaking and entering?

299
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,861
That is against everything
Nixon stood for.

300
00:14:46,862 --> 00:14:50,073
We didn't mean to cause trouble.
We're trying to make a movie about Nixon.

301
00:14:50,074 --> 00:14:53,659
Yeah? What, another leftist screed
about how corrupt he was?

302
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,036
- Uh...
- Or is it about how he had

303
00:14:55,037 --> 00:14:56,096
an illegitimate son,

304
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:59,707
and the son never knew who his dad was,
but always had a hunch it was Nixon,

305
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:03,521
and then that son grew up to be
the security guard at the Nixon Library?

306
00:15:03,962 --> 00:15:05,046
The second one?

307
00:15:05,047 --> 00:15:08,799
Well, if that's true, how come you don't
have an actor here to play Nixon?

308
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,509
Because...

309
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,805
we couldn't find anyone who could
appropriately capture his magic.

310
00:15:14,806 --> 00:15:16,908
You know, I do a pretty good Nixon.

311
00:15:16,934 --> 00:15:18,893
You? No way.

312
00:15:18,894 --> 00:15:20,437
Hello, I'm Nixon.

313
00:15:20,438 --> 00:15:24,648
I can't be at your soccer game, but I am
your father and I love you very much.

314
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:26,234
Oh, my God. He's perfect.

315
00:15:26,235 --> 00:15:27,777
We've found our Nixon.

316
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:29,820
I can be ready in five.

317
00:15:29,821 --> 00:15:31,298
Uh. Did we get the shot?

318
00:15:33,242 --> 00:15:35,594
It's so peaceful.

319
00:15:36,412 --> 00:15:38,204
- Okay, folks.
- Aah!

320
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:40,790
Party's over.
That's something we say at CrossFit.

321
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,251
Ugh. Wait a sec... I know you!

322
00:15:43,252 --> 00:15:45,753
You were in Justified.
You were amazing.

323
00:15:45,754 --> 00:15:47,088
Okay, you caught me.

324
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:49,882
I am kind of
a well-known character actress.

325
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:52,885
I am such a huge fan, Miss, uh...

326
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:54,196
What...? What's your name?

327
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:56,013
Sure, of course.

328
00:15:56,014 --> 00:15:58,617
Everyone loves my work,
but apparently not enough

329
00:15:58,642 --> 00:16:01,018
to watch the credits
and find out what my name is.

330
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:04,397
The important thing is that we enjoy
your great performances, right?

331
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:07,585
- How about you enjoy this? Aah!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

332
00:16:07,651 --> 00:16:09,986
Margo, I thought we agreed, no guns.

333
00:16:09,987 --> 00:16:13,239
Oh, is that what we agreed to?
I thought we said "no gum."

334
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,283
But you're also chewing gum.

335
00:16:15,284 --> 00:16:17,469
I'm a wild card.

336
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:20,037
- Aah!
- Return fire!

337
00:16:20,038 --> 00:16:21,432
Watch out!

338
00:16:21,873 --> 00:16:24,041
Oh, no! Alan's dead!

339
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:26,710
No, I'm fine.
The bullet hit my cell phone.

340
00:16:26,711 --> 00:16:29,922
Oh, no! Alan's cell phone is dead!

341
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:33,134
Nope, phone's fine, too.
Oh, hey, I got a text from my wife.

342
00:16:33,135 --> 00:16:36,053
She's going into labor.
Guys, I'm gonna be a dad!

343
00:16:36,054 --> 00:16:37,514
See you later!

344
00:16:42,478 --> 00:16:45,229
Die, you chunky assholes!

345
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,524
See, Jeff?
This is what I'm talking about.

346
00:16:49,026 --> 00:16:50,544
Shoot!

347
00:16:54,698 --> 00:16:56,258
Oh.

348
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:04,999
- How could this be any more perfect?
- Yoo-hoo.

349
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,502
Vanessa Gekko.
How did you get in this painting?

350
00:17:07,503 --> 00:17:09,003
I'm your servant, of course.

351
00:17:09,004 --> 00:17:11,839
In your infinite generosity,
you gave me this job

352
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,425
when it became clear
that I don't have what it takes

353
00:17:14,426 --> 00:17:16,427
to be a "Hollywoo" power-agent.

354
00:17:16,428 --> 00:17:17,928
Also, my husband left me.

355
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:21,516
And my children married each other
in an unholy incestuous union.

356
00:17:21,517 --> 00:17:24,202
Plus, I have, like, colitis or something.

357
00:17:24,228 --> 00:17:26,896
How appropriate!
Fetch me drink, wench.

358
00:17:26,897 --> 00:17:28,873
- Right away, ma'am.
- Ah.

359
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:31,568
Diane...

360
00:17:31,569 --> 00:17:34,695
The second thing you notice
about Sebastian St. Clair

361
00:17:34,696 --> 00:17:36,780
is how much he talks about himself.

362
00:17:36,781 --> 00:17:38,366
This way is the library I built.

363
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:41,035
And over there is the statue
of me building the library.

364
00:17:41,036 --> 00:17:44,247
And on that wall is a painting
of me posing for the statue.

365
00:17:44,248 --> 00:17:47,584
- Put a chapter in your book about that.
- Uh-huh.

366
00:17:47,585 --> 00:17:51,295
The only respite
from his constant bombast is sleep,

367
00:17:51,296 --> 00:17:53,106
and even then, sometimes...

368
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,846
Everybody...
Those of you who can walk, I mean.

369
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:04,326
...let's drag these corpses
to the mass grave behind the playground.

370
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:07,228
We need to make room
for my new hospital.

371
00:18:07,229 --> 00:18:10,440
- Where's Kinko? Is he okay?
- Oh, no, no, he's certainly dead.

372
00:18:10,441 --> 00:18:12,858
See, Diane,
I told you not to make friends.

373
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:15,319
Jesus, you don't care
about any of these people.

374
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,656
You're just using them as props
for your big-shot superhero act.

375
00:18:18,657 --> 00:18:21,325
Diane, the dead will not benefit
from our grief,

376
00:18:21,326 --> 00:18:25,955
but the survivors need a new hospital
and we need to build it.

377
00:18:25,956 --> 00:18:27,164
This is too much.

378
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:29,292
If you're going to survive,
you'll need to harden up.

379
00:18:29,293 --> 00:18:32,211
I asked you to join me
because I thought you could handle it.

380
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:34,648
- But if you can't, you can go home.
- I...

381
00:18:35,466 --> 00:18:36,674
I can handle it.

382
00:18:36,675 --> 00:18:39,944
Great! Let's drag some bodies!
Kinko! Oh, never mind.

383
00:18:40,804 --> 00:18:44,682
Hey, um, how come Nixon gets a line
and I don't get a line?

384
00:18:44,683 --> 00:18:46,850
We only gave him a line
so he wouldn't call the police.

385
00:18:46,851 --> 00:18:51,397
- If I call the police, will I get a line?
- No, we won't use it in the movie.

386
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:53,107
We only need the one-shot of me.

387
00:18:53,108 --> 00:18:55,693
I just think if he gets a line,
I should get a line.

388
00:18:55,694 --> 00:18:59,822
- Ugh. Actors.
- Okay, positions everyone. And... action.

389
00:18:59,823 --> 00:19:00,948
I'm Nixon.

390
00:19:00,949 --> 00:19:03,784
The way you're feeling
about your dead brother is how I feel

391
00:19:03,785 --> 00:19:06,054
about the son I'll never know.

392
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:11,417
But I look at the moon and so does he.
That's how I know we're connected.

393
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:12,876
And I'm Checkers.

394
00:19:12,877 --> 00:19:14,462
All right, so, BoJack,

395
00:19:14,463 --> 00:19:16,880
you've been told
that your brother, Jeffretariat,

396
00:19:16,881 --> 00:19:20,510
the one Nixon sent to Vietnam
in your place, is dead.

397
00:19:20,511 --> 00:19:22,553
You're feeling the weight of that guilt.

398
00:19:22,554 --> 00:19:25,031
And the tears start to flow.

399
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:27,391
And the tears start to flow.

400
00:19:27,392 --> 00:19:29,745
Oh. I don't cry in front of other people.

401
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:33,147
Well, you need to.
This is the emotional climax of the movie.

402
00:19:33,148 --> 00:19:36,609
Yeah, okay, but I don't cry in front
of other people. I can't.

403
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,901
Really, never? Come on.

404
00:19:37,902 --> 00:19:40,196
What if someone tells you
they'll take you to the park,

405
00:19:40,197 --> 00:19:42,865
and they keep talking about the park
and all the fun you'll have,

406
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:44,116
but then...

407
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:47,286
But then they don't take you to the park.
I need a second.

408
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:51,290
Well, I'm sorry, I can't do it.
I didn't know you wanted me to cry.

409
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,268
Can you give us the room, please?

410
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:56,879
There's a park right outside
we can hang out at.

411
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,632
- Oh!
- Oh, we can't, the sprinklers are on.

412
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:00,776
Ah.

413
00:20:02,927 --> 00:20:07,783
Well, another beautiful, serene day
in magical fantasy-painting world.

414
00:20:09,434 --> 00:20:12,412
Queen Princess Carolyn, if I may,
I have some exciting news.

415
00:20:12,437 --> 00:20:14,104
I just landed a new client.

416
00:20:14,105 --> 00:20:15,523
- The mill owner!
- Huh?

417
00:20:15,524 --> 00:20:18,108
We're doing a three-picture deal
about his waterwheel.

418
00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:20,152
- Wait, you're making deals here?
- I'll say.

419
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:24,156
I'm now the biggest agent
in the entire idyllic New England village.

420
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:27,410
It's like you don't even read
the idyllic New England village trades.

421
00:20:27,411 --> 00:20:28,661
What? No!

422
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:32,289
You're polluting my perfect serene
dream life. Why is this happening?

423
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,874
I don't know. It's your fantasy.

424
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,835
But if you ask me, I don't think
you want perfect and serene

425
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:39,129
and enough time to catch up
on The Good Wife.

426
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,048
Stop kidding yourself,
Princess Carolyn.

427
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:45,052
If you really wanted the simple life,
you'd have a simple life.

428
00:20:45,053 --> 00:20:47,471
Oh, my God. I gotta get out of here.

429
00:20:47,472 --> 00:20:49,658
Bye!

430
00:20:50,225 --> 00:20:53,370
Hey. Yeah, I got rid of her.
Now this place is all mine.

431
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:55,187
Get your demo guys together.

432
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:58,958
Let's tear this old Tudor down
and put up some condos!

433
00:20:59,484 --> 00:21:01,151
Okay.

434
00:21:03,988 --> 00:21:05,573
This isn't just for me.

435
00:21:05,574 --> 00:21:08,576
It's for John Carroll Lynch,
C.C.H. Pounder,

436
00:21:08,577 --> 00:21:13,080
and all the other character actors
who live in lucrative obscurity.

437
00:21:13,081 --> 00:21:15,708
The blood I spill today is for us all!

438
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:19,897
I'm character actress Margo Martindale!

439
00:21:21,214 --> 00:21:24,592
Yeah, I'm going to go
with Princess Carolyn.

440
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:28,988
Hmm.

441
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:32,600
- Hello?
- Hey.

442
00:21:32,601 --> 00:21:35,245
There you are!
I've been trying to call you all week.

443
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,814
- Yeah, the coverage in Cordovia is...
- Diane, Diane.

444
00:21:37,815 --> 00:21:39,440
Listen, I gotta tell you:

445
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:42,234
I'm sorry I gave you such
a hard time about your trip.

446
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:45,655
The truth is,
I really am so proud of you.

447
00:21:45,656 --> 00:21:47,281
A lot of people talk big,

448
00:21:47,282 --> 00:21:49,617
but you're actually out there
helping people.

449
00:21:49,618 --> 00:21:51,076
You're the real deal, Diane.

450
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:53,621
- Yeah...
- How is it there? Is it amazing?

451
00:21:53,622 --> 00:21:55,766
It's... good.

452
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:59,877
It's hard, but it's good.

453
00:21:59,878 --> 00:22:00,961
I miss you.

454
00:22:00,962 --> 00:22:03,130
I miss you, too, but I promise,

455
00:22:03,131 --> 00:22:05,675
these six months are gonna fly by.

456
00:22:05,676 --> 00:22:08,427
Yeah. How's the game show going?

457
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:12,348
Oh, shit, I completely forgot I'm supposed
to be hosting a game show right now.

458
00:22:20,148 --> 00:22:21,249
I gotta go.

459
00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:23,400
And that's when you realize

460
00:22:23,401 --> 00:22:26,069
that the book you've been writing
in your head

461
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:30,467
is never actually going to be a book,
so you stop...

462
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:35,454
I know what you're gonna say.

463
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:38,791
I'm a dumb sitcom actor
who's in over his head.

464
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:41,502
I'm sorry that I thought I could do this.

465
00:22:41,503 --> 00:22:43,546
And I'm sorry I made you come here.

466
00:22:43,547 --> 00:22:46,215
I'm sorry for everything.
I don't know what I'm doing.

467
00:22:46,216 --> 00:22:47,925
BoJack, sit down.

468
00:22:49,636 --> 00:22:53,597
You've just been told your brother is dead
and that it's your fault.

469
00:22:53,598 --> 00:22:55,349
But this moment is bigger than that.

470
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:58,686
This is the moment
that Secretariat stops running.

471
00:22:58,687 --> 00:23:01,331
Because this is the moment you realize

472
00:23:01,356 --> 00:23:06,962
something inside you is broken,
and it can never be fixed.

473
00:23:09,573 --> 00:23:10,656
We got it.

474
00:23:10,657 --> 00:23:12,157
Really? I didn't cry.

475
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:14,827
You didn't have to.
Turteltaub's gonna love this.

476
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:18,455
- Oh. All right.
- Thanks for talking me into this.

477
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:23,043
Just so you know, I'm really glad
we're making this movie together.

478
00:23:23,044 --> 00:23:27,024
- Didn't know I had it in me, did you?
- No, I knew.

479
00:23:27,382 --> 00:23:28,566
Huh.

480
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:48,712
- Hold the elevator, please.
- Coming in?

481
00:23:49,153 --> 00:23:51,214
- I'm all in.
- Whoa!

482
00:23:55,368 --> 00:23:58,370
Mommy, it's nearly Christmas.
Where's Uncle Secretariat?

483
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:01,457
He had to go win a race
against the Russians.

484
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:04,543
But maybe, if he runs really fast...

485
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:06,879
- Hey, where's Kelsey?
- Oh, yeah, funny story.

486
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,298
Turns out you two knuckleheads
snuck out last night

487
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:11,801
and got that shot
I told you not to get for the scene

488
00:24:11,802 --> 00:24:13,761
- that's not in the movie anymore.
- Uh...

489
00:24:13,762 --> 00:24:16,597
Silly me, I didn't like that.
So I fired her ass.

490
00:24:16,598 --> 00:24:18,515
- What?
- We got a movie to finish, okay?

491
00:24:18,516 --> 00:24:19,892
So, go get in costume,

492
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:22,227
get your butt up that chimney,
and do your thing, Hamlet.

493
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:27,291
Just maybe,
all we have to do is believe!

494
00:24:36,827 --> 00:24:38,076
What are you doing here?

495
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:42,039
Hey, is it cool if I crash here
for a couple nights?

496
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,976
I didn't know where else to go.

497
00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:34,151
Boxer versus raptor.
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.
