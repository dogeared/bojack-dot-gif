Oh, I'm sorry, did I startle you
with holiday cheer

5
00:00:30,528 --> 00:00:32,739
and good will towards man?

6
00:00:32,822 --> 00:00:35,825
No, I just had this terrible
dream that you were a person

7
00:00:35,826 --> 00:00:38,828
that existed and that you were
in my room for some reason.

8
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:40,371
And then I woke up and it was true.

9
00:00:40,454 --> 00:00:42,081
Do you know what day it is?

10
00:00:42,164 --> 00:00:44,249
Oh, shit, is it like our
anniversary of that one

11
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,335
day that I forgot to tell
you how annoying you are?

12
00:00:46,419 --> 00:00:48,045
No, that was July 14th.

13
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:51,006
You can remember it
because it's also Bastille Day.

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,468
- Christ, are you annoying.
- BoJack, it's Christmas!

15
00:00:57,388 --> 00:01:00,433
Well, don't get too excited.
I didn't get you shit.

16
00:01:00,516 --> 00:01:02,268
Ha! Shows what you know.

17
00:01:02,351 --> 00:01:04,771
When you were passed out,
I used your credit card

18
00:01:04,854 --> 00:01:08,148
to buy me this new hat.
Merry Christmas to me.

19
00:01:08,232 --> 00:01:10,192
It looks exactly like your old hat.

20
00:01:10,276 --> 00:01:12,862
Yeah, it's my favorite kind of hat.
Thanks, buddy!

21
00:01:12,945 --> 00:01:15,448
Okay, great, Christmas
transaction complete.

22
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:17,116
Please leave now.

23
00:01:17,199 --> 00:01:22,455
Or we could watch
Sabrina's Christmas Wish.

24
00:01:22,538 --> 00:01:24,039
Hard pass.

25
00:01:24,123 --> 00:01:26,375
What? Come on,
you love Horsin' Around!

26
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:28,252
Yeah, but I always skip
the Christmas ones.

27
00:01:28,335 --> 00:01:29,921
Because the themes
of family and togetherness

28
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:32,298
are a chilling reminder
of your own isolation?

29
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:34,049
No, but thank you for that.

30
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:37,470
Todd, special holiday episodes
are always stupid.

31
00:01:37,553 --> 00:01:40,013
Cynical cash grabs by greedy corporations

32
00:01:40,097 --> 00:01:42,099
looking to squeeze
a few extra Nielsen points

33
00:01:42,182 --> 00:01:44,956
out of sentimental claptrap
for mush-brained idiots who'd

34
00:01:44,957 --> 00:01:47,730
rather spend their Christmas
watching a fake family on TV

35
00:01:47,814 --> 00:01:49,482
than actually trying
to have a conversation

36
00:01:49,565 --> 00:01:52,067
with their own dumb families.

37
00:01:52,151 --> 00:01:54,528
I like it when people on TV
hug each other.

38
00:01:55,696 --> 00:01:58,950
Oh, come on, buddy!
It's Christmas!

39
00:01:59,032 --> 00:02:01,619
Fine, if it'll make you shut up,
I begrudgingly acquiesce

40
00:02:01,702 --> 00:02:03,663
to a half-hour of shared
holiday acknowledgment,

41
00:02:03,746 --> 00:02:05,832
but only because I get a residual check

42
00:02:05,915 --> 00:02:07,583
every time somebody watches one of them.

43
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:10,377
Hurray!
Begrudging acquiescence!

Eggs sunny side up,
just like you like 'em.

55
00:03:00,427 --> 00:03:03,430
The hash has been thoroughly browned

56
00:03:03,514 --> 00:03:05,892
and your pancakes have
extra chocolate chips.

57
00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:08,509
- Any questions?
- Just the one.

58
00:03:08,544 --> 00:03:11,856
Who are you and
what have you done with Olivia?

59
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:15,171
Can't a sweet, young,
lovable orphan make breakfast

60
00:03:15,172 --> 00:03:18,404
for her favorite horse without
having ulterior motives?

61
00:03:18,487 --> 00:03:20,573
You're right,
I'm sorry, Olivia, this is very sweet.

62
00:03:20,656 --> 00:03:25,828
- And speaking of ulterior motives...
- Well, I walked into that one.

63
00:03:25,912 --> 00:03:29,498
That cute leather jacket I like
is on sale at the galleria.

64
00:03:29,582 --> 00:03:32,919
As always, all roads lead
to a cute leather jacket.

65
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,549
I gotta say, I've never understood
the appeal of fashionable clothing.

66
00:03:38,632 --> 00:03:41,343
Um, that's the understatement
of the century.

67
00:03:42,636 --> 00:03:44,055
Trends come and go,

68
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:46,557
but give me a pair
of sensible winter socks,

69
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,686
and for years to come,
I can keep my tootsies toasty.

70
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,940
Haven't you kids ever heard
that it's better to give than to receive?

71
00:03:54,023 --> 00:03:57,026
Well, by that logic,
isn't giving you the opportunity

72
00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:00,863
to give me a leather jacket
really the best gift of all?

73
00:04:00,947 --> 00:04:03,783
Well, I've heard of
a one jacket mind,

74
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:05,993
but this is ridiculous.

75
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,663
"One jacket mind"?
What the hell is a one jacket mind?

76
00:04:09,747 --> 00:04:11,540
I just want to look good

77
00:04:11,624 --> 00:04:15,461
when I'm on the back
of Joey Saratoga's motorcycle.

78
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:20,091
Besides, I've never had a Christmas before

79
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:23,385
and I want to make sure
this one's really special.

80
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:25,366
Hold on, you mean to tell me you've

81
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:27,264
never had a Christmas at the orphanage?

82
00:04:27,347 --> 00:04:32,311
- What's a Christ... mas?
- What's a Christmas?

83
00:04:32,394 --> 00:04:34,772
Wha... Only the most
wonderful time of the year.

84
00:04:34,855 --> 00:04:37,733
You hang up stockings, sing carols,

85
00:04:37,817 --> 00:04:41,278
- and wait up for Santa Claus.
- What's a Santa Claus?

86
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:45,741
- What's a Santa Claus?
- Is there an echo in here?

87
00:04:45,825 --> 00:04:47,534
Santa Claus is the best.

88
00:04:47,618 --> 00:04:50,329
He's this jolly old fat man
who lives up at the North Pole,

89
00:04:50,412 --> 00:04:52,539
and every year he flies all over the world

90
00:04:52,623 --> 00:04:55,250
leaving presents for
all the good boys and girls.

91
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:58,295
We get presents
just for being good?

92
00:04:58,378 --> 00:05:01,465
That's too much, man.

93
00:05:01,548 --> 00:05:03,509
<i>That's my favorite line!</i>

94
00:05:03,592 --> 00:05:05,970
That's right,
but you have to be really good

95
00:05:06,053 --> 00:05:08,221
because Santa Claus is always watching.

96
00:05:08,305 --> 00:05:12,893
Even when we go to the bathroom?
That's too much, man.

97
00:05:12,977 --> 00:05:15,646
<i>Yeah, she said it again!</i>

98
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:18,732
This Santa Claus guy sounds
like a real piece of work.

99
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:21,318
Yowza-yowza-bo-bowza!

100
00:05:22,945 --> 00:05:24,488
You kids just wait,

101
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:26,949
this is gonna be the best
Christmas you ever had.

102
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:31,453
- So, better than no Christmas?
- A thousand times better.

103
00:05:31,537 --> 00:05:33,246
A thousand times zero is still zero.

104
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,750
- Ethan, you want those winter socks?
- Do I?

105
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:40,504
Then don't be such
a wise guy over here, eh?

106
00:05:45,216 --> 00:05:48,054
- Is Mr. Liberatore in?
- Look at you all business.

107
00:05:48,137 --> 00:05:50,973
No, "Hello, Tracy.
Your hair looks nice, Tracy.

108
00:05:51,057 --> 00:05:53,059
How's your mother, Tracy?"

109
00:05:53,142 --> 00:05:54,643
Ah, sorry, Trace,
I'm just trying to get ahead

110
00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:56,812
so I don't have to work
on Christmas this year.

111
00:05:56,896 --> 00:05:59,439
Since when do you care
about workin' on Christmas?

112
00:05:59,523 --> 00:06:01,912
Are those little rug
rats making you soft?

113
00:06:01,942 --> 00:06:04,945
No way, I'm still the top
earner at this firm.

114
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:07,280
I'll buzz Mr. Liberatore
and let him know you're here.

115
00:06:07,364 --> 00:06:10,826
I know he wanted to check your
progress on the Manzanita briefs.

116
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,870
Tracy, if you wanted
to see my briefs,

117
00:06:12,953 --> 00:06:15,455
all you had to do was ask.

118
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:18,500
Why, if I didn't know any better,
I'd say you were flirting with me.

119
00:06:20,002 --> 00:06:21,628
<i>Kiss her!</i>

120
00:06:21,712 --> 00:06:25,049
Mr. Liberatore is gonna make me
come in on Christmas, I can feel it.

121
00:06:25,132 --> 00:06:31,055
You know, he has got to be the meanest,
snootiest, penny-pinchingest...

122
00:06:31,138 --> 00:06:33,264
And he's right behind me, isn't he?

123
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:36,309
<i>Actually, I'm
listening over the intercom.</i>

124
00:06:36,393 --> 00:06:38,269
Oh!

125
00:06:38,353 --> 00:06:39,939
<i>I can't say I'm not disappointed.</i>

126
00:06:40,022 --> 00:06:42,524
<i>Time was, I thought you were a go-getter.</i>

127
00:06:42,608 --> 00:06:44,902
Hey, I go, I get.

128
00:06:44,985 --> 00:06:49,073
<i>Ever since those orphans moved in,
you've become awfully distracted.</i>

129
00:06:49,156 --> 00:06:52,785
<i>If you want to be made partner,
you'll have to show some initiative.</i>

130
00:06:52,868 --> 00:06:56,455
<i>You know, Jacob Goldstein's
coming in on Christmas.</i>

131
00:06:56,538 --> 00:06:58,916
- Jacob Goldstein's Jewish!
- He is?

132
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:01,813
<i>The boys at the country club
are not gonna like that.</i>

133
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,882
<i>Anyway, you can spend Christmas
morning with your little tater tots,</i>

134
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:09,093
<i>but I want you in here by the afternoon.</i>

135
00:07:09,176 --> 00:07:12,429
<i>Remember, this is your career
we're talking about.</i>

136
00:07:18,852 --> 00:07:22,815
- It's quiet.
- Too quiet.

137
00:07:22,898 --> 00:07:27,778
♪ And a Goober in a pear tree ♪

138
00:07:29,321 --> 00:07:31,406
Go home, Goober!

139
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:35,452
For your information,
I was invited here personally

140
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:38,164
by The Horse himself to sprinkle
a little holiday magic

141
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:41,125
into your dull, Gooberless lives.

142
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,252
Since when does Santa wear sunglasses?

143
00:07:43,335 --> 00:07:45,045
I thought it was time old Saint Nick

144
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:47,256
got a bit of an update,
you know what I'm sayin'?

145
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:51,635
Let me guess, instead of "Ho, Ho, Ho,"
it's "Yo, Yo, Yo."

146
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:56,556
And, uh, maybe later I could get you
under the mistletoe-toe-toe?

147
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,019
I've got three words for you Goober:
No, no, no.

148
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:02,688
<i>Kiss her!</i>

149
00:08:02,771 --> 00:08:05,691
All right, Sabrina,
are you ready for the big surprise?

150
00:08:05,774 --> 00:08:11,113
A tree inside the house?
Now I've seen everything.

151
00:08:11,197 --> 00:08:13,448
And that's not all.
Look who came to visit.

152
00:08:13,532 --> 00:08:16,803
- Hey!
Go home, Goober.

153
00:08:18,537 --> 00:08:20,413
No, that's not Goober, it's Santa.

154
00:08:20,497 --> 00:08:24,584
Please, I'd recognize
that cologne anywhere.

155
00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:27,046
You had to wear the cologne.

156
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:29,631
<i>Ha, classic Goober.</i>

157
00:08:29,715 --> 00:08:31,133
Are you gonna keep talking?
'Cause I'll just pause it.

158
00:08:31,217 --> 00:08:33,468
Okay, okay, I won't talk.

159
00:08:33,552 --> 00:08:37,181
- You're getting into it, aren't you?
- No, why are we doing this?

160
00:08:37,264 --> 00:08:40,184
You have to watch cheesy old
holiday specials on Christmas,

161
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:43,020
- it's tradition.
- Why? They're never any good.

162
00:08:43,103 --> 00:08:45,939
Things don't become traditions
because they're good, BoJack.

163
00:08:46,023 --> 00:08:48,817
They become good
because they're traditions.

164
00:08:48,901 --> 00:08:50,903
You know, you can't just
make yourself sound smart

165
00:08:50,986 --> 00:08:54,781
- by saying things backwards.
- Oh, I can't, can't I?

166
00:08:54,865 --> 00:08:56,742
Still don't believe I let you
talk me into this.

167
00:08:56,825 --> 00:08:58,618
And I still don't believe Goober

168
00:08:58,702 --> 00:09:00,704
ended up molesting all those Laker Girls.

169
00:09:00,787 --> 00:09:03,040
Goober did not molest those Laker Girls,

170
00:09:03,123 --> 00:09:05,918
the actor who played Goober
molested those Laker Girls.

171
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:10,756
- Hey, this is nice, right?
- No, shut up.

172
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:13,466
All right, all right,
little lady, you got me.

173
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,262
But, uh, listen,
I'm actually workin' for Santa

174
00:09:16,345 --> 00:09:18,680
as one of his helpers,
so anything you say to me

175
00:09:18,764 --> 00:09:20,724
I can relay to the big man himself.

176
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:22,642
Is there anything you want
to ask Santa for?

177
00:09:22,726 --> 00:09:24,770
Now's your chance, anything you want.

178
00:09:24,853 --> 00:09:28,815
Well, I guess what I really want
is a personalized pencil set.

179
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:30,776
A pencil set? Sabrina!

180
00:09:30,859 --> 00:09:34,110
At the orphanage,
I always had to share everything.

181
00:09:35,072 --> 00:09:38,409
If I pencils that had my name on them,
everyone would know,

182
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:43,997
"Hey, these pencils are Sabrina's!
Hands off, bumsky!"

183
00:09:44,081 --> 00:09:46,583
I don't think you're getting
this whole Christmas thing.

184
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,211
You can ask for anything,
you don't have to be shy.

185
00:09:49,295 --> 00:09:53,090
Well, I guess I wouldn't mind
a Pretty Pony Princess play set.

186
00:09:53,173 --> 00:09:54,716
Now you're thinking Christmas.

187
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,137
Keep going, what do you want
more than anything else in the world?

188
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,473
- I can ask Santa for anything?
- Anything at all.

189
00:10:01,556 --> 00:10:04,517
And if I'm good,
Santa has to give it to me?

190
00:10:04,601 --> 00:10:07,062
That's the deal, as long as you're good,

191
00:10:07,146 --> 00:10:09,773
all your Christmas dreams will come true.

192
00:10:09,856 --> 00:10:12,318
Okay, I know what I want.

193
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:16,155
Santa, I want my Mommy
and Daddy to come back!

194
00:10:19,158 --> 00:10:21,534
- Aww.
- Aww.

195
00:10:21,618 --> 00:10:25,956
- Ooh!
- This is gonna be the best Christmas ever.

196
00:10:27,207 --> 00:10:31,086
<i>Look how sad you are,
you're a really good actor.</i>

197
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,545
Are you gonna interrupt
every five minutes?

198
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:36,383
- Because I will ask you to leave.
- And spend Christmas by yourself?

199
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:38,344
No one should be alone on Christmas.

200
00:10:38,427 --> 00:10:41,096
Did we learn nothing from
John McClane in "Die Hard"?

201
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,224
John McClane was alone on Christmas,
that's how he saved the day.

202
00:10:44,308 --> 00:10:46,685
He wasn't alone,
he had that cop helping him,

203
00:10:46,768 --> 00:10:48,561
the dad from Family Matters.

204
00:10:48,645 --> 00:10:51,898
That wasn't the dad from Family Matters,
it was just the same actor.

205
00:10:51,982 --> 00:10:54,818
I'm pretty sure
it's supposed to be the same character,

206
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:57,696
- they're both cops.
- Yeah, but one was a cop in Los Angeles

207
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:00,532
- and the other was a cop in Chicago.
- Maybe he moved.

208
00:11:00,615 --> 00:11:02,909
He didn't move,
they had different names!

209
00:11:02,993 --> 00:11:05,496
Witness Protection.

210
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,793
- Hey, this is nice, right?
- No!

211
00:11:16,131 --> 00:11:20,386
Oh, Charles Krauthammer,
you have done it again.

212
00:11:20,469 --> 00:11:22,721
Yes, Mr. Liberatore.
Of course, Mr. Liberatore,

213
00:11:22,804 --> 00:11:24,264
I'll get right on it, sir.

214
00:11:24,348 --> 00:11:29,644
Yeesh, I've heard of being a work
horse, but this is ridiculous.

215
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:32,605
I just hate that he's making you
work on Christmas.

216
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:37,069
- What is this, Communist Russia?
- I know, it's a bummer,

217
00:11:37,152 --> 00:11:38,904
but we can find other times
to be together.

218
00:11:38,987 --> 00:11:41,114
Hey, maybe I'll chaperone your prom.

219
00:11:41,198 --> 00:11:44,535
I can meet all your friends,
talk you up to this Joey Saratoga fella,

220
00:11:44,617 --> 00:11:46,661
maybe even take a spin on the dance floor.

221
00:11:46,745 --> 00:11:50,416
You know, back in my day,
I could really bust the regular move.

222
00:11:57,256 --> 00:11:59,425
Well, just got done shoveling the walk!

223
00:11:59,508 --> 00:12:02,740
I'm being really good just so
there's no confusion for Santa

224
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:05,972
over whether or not he should
make my Christmas wish come true.

225
00:12:06,056 --> 00:12:11,019
Santa, if you're listening,
I'm Sabrina!

226
00:12:11,103 --> 00:12:13,646
Sabrina, I'm glad you're getting
into the Christmas spirit,

227
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,359
but, you know, bringing your
parents back is a pretty tall order.

228
00:12:17,484 --> 00:12:20,279
Not for Santa.
Santa can do anything,

229
00:12:20,362 --> 00:12:22,781
just as long as I believe, right, guys?

230
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,910
You wanna handle this one?

231
00:12:26,993 --> 00:12:30,663
Sabrina, there are some things
even Santa can't do.

232
00:12:30,747 --> 00:12:33,125
Okay, I get what's happening.

233
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:36,607
You're trying to make me think
Santa won't bring me my Mommy

234
00:12:36,608 --> 00:12:40,006
and Daddy so that when he does,
I'll be even more surprised.

235
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:43,343
Just when I thought Christmas
couldn't get any more magical.

236
00:12:43,427 --> 00:12:44,886
See you later!

237
00:12:53,228 --> 00:12:55,646
I've heard of great
Christmas expectations,

238
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:59,610
but this is ridiculous.
Now no matter what Santa brings,

239
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:04,823
she'll go from "reindeer" to "reindon't."
What are we gonna do?

240
00:13:04,906 --> 00:13:07,784
Horse, maybe you should tell her
that her parents aren't coming.

241
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:10,496
I can't do that, she'll never
believe in Santa Claus again.

242
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:13,873
And we're sure Santa can't
bring people back from the dead?

243
00:13:13,957 --> 00:13:18,420
On Dancer, on Prancer, 
on Necromancer?

244
00:13:18,504 --> 00:13:20,506
I'm thinkin' no.

245
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:22,424
Oh, my God, I got it.

246
00:13:22,508 --> 00:13:27,762
Maybe if we can trick her into being
bad, she'll think Santa's mad at her.

247
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:30,723
That way, when Christmas comes
and her parents don't show up,

248
00:13:30,807 --> 00:13:33,519
she'll just think it's her own fault.

249
00:13:33,602 --> 00:13:37,293
Brilliant! She'll still believe
in Santa, plus she'll be extra

250
00:13:37,294 --> 00:13:40,984
well-behaved for the whole year
so she doesn't blow it again.

251
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:44,321
Hold on, you kids want me
to trick Sabrina into being bad

252
00:13:44,404 --> 00:13:46,615
just so she won't stop believing Santa?

253
00:13:46,697 --> 00:13:50,076
Never in a million years would
I resort to something so low.

254
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,162
No, we better keep brainstorming

255
00:13:52,245 --> 00:13:55,582
because I am definitely
not doing that idea.

256
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,876
How desperate do you think I am?

257
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:01,296
You are really scraping the
bottom of the barrel with that one.

258
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,924
No, I will clearly not be
pursuing that line of action.

259
00:14:05,008 --> 00:14:06,885
No way, no how.

260
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:11,515
So, you want me to sit here
and watch the cookies

261
00:14:11,598 --> 00:14:15,060
but not eat them?
This seems like a trick.

262
00:14:15,143 --> 00:14:18,355
<i>He's doing the thing
he said he wasn't gonna do!</i>

263
00:14:18,438 --> 00:14:20,232
These cookies are for Santa.

264
00:14:20,315 --> 00:14:22,984
If anyone eats them, he'll be really mad.

265
00:14:23,068 --> 00:14:27,322
I need you to guard them.
It's a very important job.

266
00:14:27,406 --> 00:14:32,160
Well, I guess it is about time
I start earning my keep around here.

267
00:14:32,244 --> 00:14:33,912
I knew I could count on you.

268
00:14:33,995 --> 00:14:37,332
Remember, no matter what,
don't eat these delicious,

269
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:42,629
home made, fresh out of the oven,
warm, gooey, chocolate chip delights.

270
00:14:42,713 --> 00:14:45,257
I'll leave you here alone...
with these cookies...

271
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,300
which are delicious.

272
00:14:51,346 --> 00:14:53,973
Okay, cookies, it's just you and me.

273
00:14:54,057 --> 00:14:58,978
Ooh, they look so yummy.
What would Mommy and Daddy say?

274
00:14:59,062 --> 00:15:02,982
"Sabrina, I'm your Daddy and I say,
'Don't eat the cookies!'"

275
00:15:03,066 --> 00:15:07,404
"Listen to your Father, honey,
he knows what's best."

276
00:15:07,487 --> 00:15:11,428
Okay, Mommy and Daddy, I love you.

277
00:15:15,537 --> 00:15:17,539
I don't think she's taking the bait.

278
00:15:17,623 --> 00:15:19,291
That's because you didn't
put any milk out.

279
00:15:19,374 --> 00:15:21,084
You can't have cookies without milk.

280
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:24,671
- That's like Wang without the Chung.
- Any chance she'll crack?

281
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:25,964
I'd say your odds are about as good

282
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:29,175
as a democrat being elected president.

283
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:31,886
Yeesh, I've heard of "lookie, lookie,
don't eat the cookie,"

284
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,014
but this is ridiculous.

285
00:15:35,098 --> 00:15:36,683
What?

286
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:38,560
You guys got any other bright ideas?

287
00:15:38,644 --> 00:15:43,022
Maybe I should go eat the cookies?

288
00:15:43,106 --> 00:15:47,235
Well, if she's not gonna, somebody should.

289
00:15:49,237 --> 00:15:51,948
<i>- Oh, my God, it's Christmas!
- Oh, it's Christmas!</i>

290
00:15:52,031 --> 00:15:54,993
Yes, sensible winter socks!
You knew!

291
00:15:55,076 --> 00:15:59,997
- Ooh, what could this be?
- Well, I wanted to make sure

292
00:15:59,998 --> 00:16:03,168
you look really cool
on the back of that motorcycle.

293
00:16:03,251 --> 00:16:06,338
You didn't! You didn't!

294
00:16:07,422 --> 00:16:09,549
You didn't.

295
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:12,594
Motorcycle crashes are one of the
leading causes of brain injury.

296
00:16:12,678 --> 00:16:15,305
If Joey Saratoga doesn't care about this,

297
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:18,558
then Joey Saratoga
doesn't care about you.

298
00:16:18,642 --> 00:16:22,061
Wow, this present shows you really care,

299
00:16:22,145 --> 00:16:26,650
so in a way it's even cooler
than a new leather jacket.

300
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:31,112
Take it from me,
being safe is totally radical.

301
00:16:31,196 --> 00:16:33,114
Is this my present?

302
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:36,034
It's a Pretty Pony Princess play set,
just like you asked for.

303
00:16:36,117 --> 00:16:39,954
- Is that it?
- Well, it's pretty cool.

304
00:16:40,038 --> 00:16:41,873
She comes with a tiara and everything.

305
00:16:41,956 --> 00:16:45,061
Oh, okay.

306
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:50,965
And cue the waterworks in 30, 29, 28...

307
00:17:02,268 --> 00:17:06,857
...four, three, two, and...

308
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:10,443
- Hey, what's this?
- A letter? Who could this be from?

309
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:11,820
Open it, Sabrina.

310
00:17:11,903 --> 00:17:14,614
Oh, wow.
Wow!

311
00:17:14,698 --> 00:17:17,075
- Wow!
- What does it say?

312
00:17:17,158 --> 00:17:19,994
How should I know?
I can't read.

313
00:17:21,747 --> 00:17:25,291
"Dear Sabrina,
this is a letter from your parents.

314
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,878
Even though we can't be
with you on Christmas,

315
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,921
we're in heaven looking down on you

316
00:17:30,004 --> 00:17:32,549
and we want you to know
we love you very much.

317
00:17:32,632 --> 00:17:35,635
You are a good girl
and we are very proud of you.

318
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:39,278
Love, Your Mommy and Daddy."

319
00:17:39,598 --> 00:17:43,685
Isn't that great, Sabrina?
A letter from your Mom and Dad.

320
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:47,397
- No, that's not what I asked for.
- Sabrina...

321
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,609
I didn't want a stupid letter,
I wanted my Mommy and Daddy.

322
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:53,695
- I know you're upset, but...
- I hate this.

323
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:56,322
I hate Santa Claus and I hate trees

324
00:17:56,406 --> 00:18:00,076
and I hate you
and I hate Christmas!

325
00:18:05,624 --> 00:18:08,627
Was it something I said?

326
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,587
Why would it be
something Ethan said?

327
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,423
No, that's the joke,
it wasn't something Ethan said,

328
00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:18,177
- that's why it's funny.
- Oh... Okay.

329
00:18:21,514 --> 00:18:24,434
- Can I come in?
- Even if I say no,

330
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:26,895
it's not like anyone ever listens
to what I want.

331
00:18:28,146 --> 00:18:30,398
Sabrina, I really screwed things up.

332
00:18:30,482 --> 00:18:33,401
I got so excited trying
to make you excited,

333
00:18:33,485 --> 00:18:35,821
I forgot the true meaning of Christmas.

334
00:18:35,904 --> 00:18:38,448
Christmas isn't about getting
everything you want.

335
00:18:38,531 --> 00:18:41,660
It's about being around the people
that care about you.

336
00:18:41,743 --> 00:18:43,453
I did everything right.

337
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:46,414
Why wouldn't Santa Claus
want me to be happy?

338
00:18:46,498 --> 00:18:48,416
I'm sure he does, he just...

339
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,252
Santa Claus works in mysterious ways.

340
00:18:51,336 --> 00:18:54,840
It's like when I make you eat vegetables.
Sure, they taste yucky,

341
00:18:54,923 --> 00:18:57,634
but you have to trust that I know
what's good for you.

342
00:18:57,717 --> 00:19:00,938
So, Santa Claus made
my parents dead because

343
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,556
- he thinks it's good for me?
- Yeah... No!

344
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,143
- Santa Claus didn't make your parents dead.
- But he didn't save them either.

345
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:09,646
No, he...
That's not how Santa works.

346
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:11,982
You said Santa Claus is always watching,

347
00:19:12,064 --> 00:19:14,484
so if he's watching
why doesn't he help us?

348
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:18,989
Does he enjoy watching us be sad?
Is that how he gets his kicks?

349
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:21,533
- No!
- Are we all just pawns in Santa's sick game?

350
00:19:21,616 --> 00:19:23,743
What kind of pervert is he?

351
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:26,705
Oh, no, Santa's watching us right now!

352
00:19:26,788 --> 00:19:29,875
I'm sorry, Santa!
I didn't mean it.

353
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,668
Please don't hurt the people I love.

354
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:34,504
No, Sabrina, Santa Claus isn't real.

355
00:19:34,587 --> 00:19:36,339
What?

356
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:38,654
He's a lie that grownups
made up because we like

357
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:40,886
to believe that there's
an order to the universe

358
00:19:40,969 --> 00:19:42,762
and that good behavior
will lead to happiness,

359
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:44,848
but the fact is that just isn't true.

360
00:19:44,931 --> 00:19:46,224
<i>What?</i>

361
00:19:46,307 --> 00:19:48,309
You can't be good
just because you think

362
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,687
some fat guy in a red suit
is gonna bring you presents.

363
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:53,773
You have to be good just to be good.
That's all there is.

364
00:19:53,857 --> 00:19:57,109
- Whoa...
- Look, I don't know why things happen,

365
00:19:57,193 --> 00:19:58,653
I don't know why
some people get everything

366
00:19:58,737 --> 00:20:00,405
and some people are orphans.

367
00:20:00,488 --> 00:20:03,783
All I know is I spent last Christmas
alone at my office.

368
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:05,284
I didn't get a tree,

369
00:20:05,368 --> 00:20:07,996
I didn't put up any decorations
or sing carols,

370
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:12,124
and I didn't try to get any little girls
to believe in Santa Claus.

371
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,126
Sabrina, you and Olivia and Ethan

372
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,170
are the best things that
have ever happened to me,

373
00:20:16,254 --> 00:20:18,610
and if it took your parents
dying for you to be part

374
00:20:18,611 --> 00:20:20,967
of my life, well, then
I'm glad your parents died.

375
00:20:21,051 --> 00:20:22,928
Oh, you don't mean that.

376
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:25,555
No, I do, I'm glad
your parents are dead

377
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:27,265
and are never coming back.

378
00:20:27,348 --> 00:20:31,354
Well, when you put it that way,
I guess I am, too.

379
00:20:33,145 --> 00:20:35,815
I know that sometimes
I make a mess of this whole thing,

380
00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:37,776
a horse raising three
human kids while also

381
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:39,861
juggling work and trying
to have a love life thing,

382
00:20:39,945 --> 00:20:44,156
- but there's one more present.
- Is it from Santa Claus?

383
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,994
- No, it's from me.
- Oh!

384
00:20:48,078 --> 00:20:51,289
Wow, pencils!
What do they say?

385
00:20:51,372 --> 00:20:54,960
- Sound it out.
- Sa... Sab...

386
00:20:55,043 --> 00:20:56,628
Sabrin...

387
00:20:56,711 --> 00:20:59,297
rine...
rine...

388
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,425
Sab...
Sabrine...

389
00:21:02,508 --> 00:21:06,471
Sabrinay.
Sabrinay.

390
00:21:06,554 --> 00:21:08,473
- It says Sabrina.
- Oh!

391
00:21:08,556 --> 00:21:11,935
I can't bring your Mommy and Daddy back,
but as long as I'm around,

392
00:21:12,018 --> 00:21:13,812
you'll always have a place
to keep your pencils.

393
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,189
Thanks.
Maybe it's just because

394
00:21:17,273 --> 00:21:18,733
I never had a Christmas before,

395
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:21,486
but this is the best
Christmas I've ever had.

396
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:22,654
Me, too.

397
00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:28,785
Olivia, Ethan, look what I got!

398
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:32,580
<i>Hello?</i>

399
00:21:32,664 --> 00:21:34,082
Listen, Mr. Liberatore,

400
00:21:34,165 --> 00:21:36,417
I've given it a lot of thought
and I'm not...

401
00:21:36,501 --> 00:21:38,252
Well, I'm not comin' in to work today.

402
00:21:38,336 --> 00:21:41,798
If I have to choose between my career
and the people I care about,

403
00:21:41,881 --> 00:21:44,509
well, then I'm sorry,
but I'm putting people first.

404
00:21:46,761 --> 00:21:50,181
<i>You know, it took guts
to call in and tell me that,</i>

405
00:21:50,264 --> 00:21:53,267
<i>the kind of guts we need
on our executive board.</i>

406
00:21:53,351 --> 00:21:57,856
<i>If that Scrooge, Jacob Goldstein,
wants to work on Christmas,</i>

407
00:21:57,939 --> 00:22:02,568
<i>- he can work somewhere else!
- Fire that Jew!</i>

408
00:22:02,652 --> 00:22:04,529
<i>I'm making you partner.</i>

409
00:22:04,612 --> 00:22:06,948
Well, I'm really glad
to hear that, Mr. Liberatore.

410
00:22:07,032 --> 00:22:08,658
Now if you'll excuse me,

411
00:22:08,741 --> 00:22:11,161
I have to go spend Christmas
with the people I love.

412
00:22:14,288 --> 00:22:18,043
Hi, I'm a Pretty Pony Princess.
I'm a pencil.

413
00:22:18,126 --> 00:22:20,378
Well, I guess everything turned out okay.

414
00:22:20,461 --> 00:22:22,005
How'd you get her to come back down?

415
00:22:22,088 --> 00:22:28,723
Let's just say I made her
an offer she couldn't refuse.

416
00:22:28,928 --> 00:22:30,930
Yowza-yowza-bo-bowza!

417
00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:38,188
Well, I gotta hand it to you,
even though it didn't work,

418
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,024
that letter you wrote
was really something.

419
00:22:41,107 --> 00:22:43,693
I didn't write that letter.
I thought you wrote that letter.

420
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:46,529
- I didn't write the letter.
- Wasn't me.

421
00:22:46,612 --> 00:22:49,239
Then where'd it come from?

422
00:22:52,577 --> 00:22:54,204
<i>Ho, ho, ho!</i>

423
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,293
Well, that sucked.

424
00:23:01,377 --> 00:23:03,504
So the letter was actually
from her parents?

425
00:23:03,588 --> 00:23:06,298
Uh, I think it was from Santa.

426
00:23:06,382 --> 00:23:08,885
That's why there was a
"ho, ho, ho" voice at the end.

427
00:23:08,968 --> 00:23:12,097
So in the world of this show,
there is a Santa.

428
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,058
No, I don't know,
we were all on cocaine.

429
00:23:15,141 --> 00:23:17,060
God, I can't believe I spent
nine years of my life

430
00:23:17,143 --> 00:23:20,646
- making that dumb show.
- It wasn't all dumb, BoJack.

431
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,774
The episode where Sabrina
had a black friend

432
00:23:22,857 --> 00:23:25,735
really started the conversation
about racism.

433
00:23:25,818 --> 00:23:28,049
And the episode where
Ethan looked directly at

434
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,280
a solar eclipse really
started the conversation

435
00:23:30,364 --> 00:23:33,034
about not looking directly
at a solar eclipse.

436
00:23:33,118 --> 00:23:37,205
- Yeah...
- Well, anyway, Merry Christmas.

437
00:23:37,287 --> 00:23:41,333
I know, it's really just another day
in a year full of days,

438
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:45,295
nothing all that special about it
other than the significance we give it,

439
00:23:45,379 --> 00:23:48,800
but still, I'm glad I got to spend
part of the day with you, BoJack.

440
00:23:48,883 --> 00:23:51,094
- Really?
- Yeah.

441
00:23:51,177 --> 00:23:55,807
Hey, um, Horsin' Around had
eight other Christmas episodes.

442
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,726
If you're not doing anything else today,
we could watch another one,

443
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:01,311
I mean, just to see how stupid it is.

444
00:24:01,395 --> 00:24:02,981
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

445
00:24:03,064 --> 00:24:04,274
But don't talk in the middle of it.

446
00:24:04,356 --> 00:24:06,525
- Zip!
- You can talk a little bit.

447
00:24:06,609 --> 00:24:09,195
- Don't be weird about it.
- Okay.

448
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,005
<i>Hey, after we watch "Horsin' Around,"</i>

449
00:24:11,006 --> 00:24:13,491
<i>- can we make holiday cookies?
- No.</i>

450
00:24:13,574 --> 00:24:15,076
<i>- Can we sing carols?
- No.</i>

451
