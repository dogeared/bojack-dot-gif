1
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:16,767
Oh, no. No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

2
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,812
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, but
there was another mass shooting.

3
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,731
Oh, God, where?

4
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,483
A town outside Tampa called...

5
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,110
Not geographically, dipshit.
What's the location?

6
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,279
What is it, a pharmacy? A haberdashery?

7
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:33,075
- It was a shopping mall.
- No!

8
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:37,287
- Ms. Taken is coming out next month.
- I know, sir.

9
00:00:37,352 --> 00:00:39,432
The whole third act revolves
around Courtney Portnoy

10
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:40,832
shooting people in a mall.

11
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,543
What are we supposed to do
now, not release the movie?

12
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,212
I hope it doesn't come to that.

13
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,673
I am sick and tired of
real-life gun violence

14
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,759
getting in the way of us telling
stories that glamorize gun violence.

15
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,179
Why does this keep happening?
Has the whole world gone crazy?

16
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:57,849
No, we've just been conditioned
by a rugged individualist culture

17
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,644
woven into the savage architecture
of our country itself,

18
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,479
birthed as it was through
violent uprising,

19
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,399
but perhaps popularized in the
modern imagination by stories of...

20
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,109
Okay, Chomsky, when I want you to talk,

21
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,232
I'll staple a string to
your back and then yank it.

22
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,487
Why not make yourself useful

23
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,651
and schedule a sit-down with
Courtney Portnoy's team

24
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,534
to talk about how we distance ourselves
from this fakakte mishegoss.

25
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,870
Got it. Except for the
foccacia Michigan part.

26
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:22,332
Excuse me, could you point me
in the direction of an H&M?

27
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:26,169
Sure. But when you get
there, you're gonna be DOA.

28
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:29,381
Uh-uh. You picked the wrong
shopaholic to mess with.

29
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,926
Because this shopaholic's
also a holic for revenge.

30
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,762
Die, scum!

31
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,597
Courtney Portnoy-vey.

synced & corrected by PopcornAWH
www.addic7ed.com.

33
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:38,075
- Wow. Carla Mercedes Benzbrown.
- Yep.

34
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,868
- My mother.
- That's right.

35
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,291
- I lied!
- What?

36
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,043
There's no Carla Mercedes Benzbrown.

37
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,961
- I have no idea who your mother is.
- What?

38
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,285
I don't want to have a
relationship lying to each other.

39
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,174
Okay, so why did you lie to me?

40
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,842
I meant everything else I said.

41
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,844
I'll do everything I can
to help find your mom.

42
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,013
To be honest, moms
aren't all that great.

43
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,137
In fact, in my experience,
they're soulless succubi

44
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,782
born fully formed from the ass of Satan.

45
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,436
Oh, my grandmother sounds
like quite a character.

46
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,813
- Can I meet her?
- Oh, my mom?

47
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:11,358
No, you cannot meet my mom
because she's... dead.

48
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,651
- Oh.
- Dead mom.

49
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,198
BoJack, what happened to
the fudgesicles I bought?

50
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,326
- I lied again. My mom's not dead.
- Stop lying to me!

51
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,496
That was, like, 15 minutes of lie.
Plus, you don't want to meet my mom.

52
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,997
I do. Where does she live?

53
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,542
Oh, this spectacular
elder care facility,

54
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,465
she has her own private
room with a nice view,

55
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,837
'round-the-clock medical care,

56
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,673
and plenty of other seniors to
say casually cruel things to

57
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,050
under a passive-aggressive
veil of plausible deniability.

58
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,260
What's this place called?

59
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,847
I want to say Whispering Pines.
Whistling Pines?

60
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,140
Unbelievable.

61
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,767
Something with a W. Winter's Bone?

62
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,394
- Take me there.
- Fine!

63
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,813
- For real this time?
- Yes. I promise.

64
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,357
I am not gonna lie to you ever again.

65
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,484
- Did you eat the last fudgesicle?
- No.

66
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,405
I lied. I lied about the fudgesicle.

67
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,952
All this time you thought I was
just another damsel in distress,

68
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,997
but I'm afraid you were mis... guided.

69
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,292
Oh... oh.

70
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,252
- That is not good.
- Okay.

71
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,463
Everybody set a Google
Alert for "mass shooting."

72
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,256
Can't keep getting caught off guard.

73
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,340
This is so sad.

74
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,719
You always hear about mass shootings
affecting other people's movie openings,

75
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:24,306
but you never think they're gonna
affect your movie opening.

76
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,808
My thoughts and prayers to the
victims and their families.

77
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,412
- Of course. Yeah, thoughts and prayers.
- Thoughts and prayers.

78
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,855
Tragedy like this really
puts things in perspective.

79
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,107
Like, what are we doing
sitting in a conference room?

80
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,277
Life is short. We should have
this meeting at a water park.

81
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,489
Whoa! A water park where
people have meetings.

82
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,892
- Maybe that's the movie.
- I'm sorry, who is this schmuck?

83
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,826
I'm Courtney's asexual fake fiancé.

84
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,745
He's a common person/supermodel,

85
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,831
being engaged to him makes me
appear more approachable/glamorous.

86
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:53,376
Okay-slash-whatever. We still have time
to cut the mall shootout from the film.

87
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,260
That still leaves the
movie theater shootout,

88
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,040
the shootout at the county fair, the...

89
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,384
We should probably lose the
movie theater shootout.

90
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,595
Right. Well, we still have
the county fair shootout.

91
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,472
Oh, dear.

92
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,599
- This is a sad day.
- What?

93
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,309
I gotta take this.

94
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,685
- BoJack?
- Hi.

95
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,270
- Where have you been?
- Listen.

96
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,523
I'm sorry. I was an
awful boyfriend to you.

97
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:17,067
I was an awful client, and
I was an awful friend.

98
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,236
This last year I spent some time away

99
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,948
and it made me realize how special
the people in my life are.

100
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,492
And you might be the most
special of them all.

101
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,827
Wow, BoJack.

102
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,912
I... I appreciate that.

103
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,915
Anyway, the real reason I'm calling is,

104
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,085
do you remember the name of that
super nice elder care facility

105
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,980
that we both agreed was the best place
for my mom to run out the clock?

106
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,173
Oh, pluck a duck. It's
called Walnut Springs.

107
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:43,134
Walnut Springs! I knew there
was a W in there. Bye!

108
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,512
What?

109
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,235
I feel like I didn't strike the
right tone in the last phone call.

110
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,433
I really am sorry, and the
most important thing is,

111
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,894
you know how dedicated I am
to making things right again.

112
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,020
Okay. Thank you.

113
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,981
Anyway, the real reason I'm calling is,

114
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,817
turns out there's a few Walnut
Springses in the SoCal area.

115
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,777
It's the one in Santa Barbara, dummy!

116
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,281
- Yeesh! Cranky much? Who died?
- A lotta people!

117
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,283
Sorry, what did I miss?

118
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,786
Courtney's beloved was outlining
his plan to curtail gun violence.

119
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:13,790
I'm just saying, if people have
the right pumped-up kicks,

120
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,167
maybe they can outrun the bullets.

121
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,670
All this talk of gun
violence is depressing.

122
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,174
Ms. Taken is a movie about empowerment.

123
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:22,406
That's what I've been saying!

124
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,665
It's Bridget Jones with
slightly more bloody murdering.

125
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:27,178
We just have to keep
the story on Courtney,

126
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,639
and not on the depressingly
unstoppable rise

127
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,350
of real-life gun violence in this
country, thoughts and prayers.

128
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,274
- Thoughts and prayers.
- Thoughts and prayers.

129
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,032
Oh.

130
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,237
The House Majority
Whip outlined a new bipartisan plan

131
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,324
to encourage you to answer
your ringing phone.

132
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:51,202
For Thursday, October
12, this is All Rings Considered.

133
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,371
- I'm Robert Siegel.
- And I'm Audie Cornish.

134
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,541
The proposed bill would take effect
when someone tries to call you

135
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,305
and you hear this ringtone.

136
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,295
- Hello?
- Diane!

137
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,088
I got an exclusive for you.

138
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:06,051
You are going to write a glowing feature
about my client and her new movie.

139
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,094
- Why would I...
- You know Courtney Portnoy.

140
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,431
You probably recall when she soared
as the thorny horticulturist

141
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,309
in One Sordid Fortnight With
the Short-Skirted Sorceress.

142
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,103
- Uh...
- How would you enjoy joining Portnoy

143
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,398
for a scorched soy porterhouse
pork four-courser at Koi?

144
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,192
- Wait, what?
- Glorify your source,

145
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:26,237
but don't make it feel forced, of
course, and try the borscht. Smooches!

146
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,156
- Hey...
- And that's how you do it, folks.

147
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,161
Oh...

148
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,872
You're telling me you didn't
feel one twinge of guilt

149
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,666
when you left your mom in this place?

150
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,877
Uh... twinge of guilt, twinge of
guilt, trying to remember, no.

151
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,087
- Definitely not.
- Damn.

152
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,380
You didn't know my mom.

153
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,425
Football? You don't have
the haunches for it.

154
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,524
You'll only embarrass yourself, as
in every other endeavor you pursue.

155
00:07:50,587 --> 00:07:51,610
But, Mom...

156
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,240
If you're looking to get knocked around

157
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,768
for an afternoon, why don't you just
read one of your father's manuscripts

158
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,312
and tell him his prose is
pedestrian and derivative?

159
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,647
Works for me every time.

160
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,821
Mrs. Horseman, you have a visitor.

161
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:10,865
Oh, uh...

162
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,410
- Hi, Mom.
- Do I know you?

163
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,371
Here we go. Yes, Mom, I never visit.
You got me.

164
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,581
- Henrietta?
- Okay, we're doing this?

165
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,625
I think she really doesn't
know who you are.

166
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,589
She knows. This is just
like when she pretended

167
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,755
not to recognize me after my shaky
choir solo in eighth grade.

168
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,799
I had to get a ride
home with the pianist

169
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,218
who liked to tickle a lot
more than just the ivories.

170
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,888
When I made it home unscathed, she
said, "Huh. I guess no one wants you."

171
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,933
Henrietta, could I trouble you
for some orange juice, please?

172
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:39,286
Stop calling me Henrietta!
Nobody here's named Henrietta!

173
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,062
Henrietta, orange juice. Now!

174
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,986
You're not being paid for
polite conversation.

175
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,548
- BoJack, maybe you should just...
- Oh, hello! It's you.

176
00:08:45,642 --> 00:08:46,693
Hollyhock.

177
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:51,948
I must apologize for Henrietta. She
learned to read on secondhand books.

178
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,702
Mom, do you really not know who I am?
Me, famous BoJack?

179
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,580
If you are getting orange
juice, I'd love a glass too.

180
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,416
Oh. Uh, okay.

181
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:07,380
So you see I'm really quite
ordinary and relatable.

182
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,883
Yeah, you put your pants
on one leg at a time.

183
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,011
Well, I step into my
pants one leg at a time,

184
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,347
then my trouser-maidens lift the legs
simultaneously to avoid wrinklage.

185
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:19,517
Well, right, of course, why
else have trouser-maidens?

186
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:23,313
- Hey. Konichiwa, Princess Mulan.
- Just leave us alone, okay?

187
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,689
I was giving you a compliment.

188
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:27,253
First, konichiwa is not a compliment,
it's Japanese for hello.

189
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,526
Second, I'm not Japanese.

190
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,862
Maybe I could put something
in that sweet mouth of yours

191
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,114
- so you don't have to talk so much.
- Whoa!

192
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,866
One more step, asshole.

193
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,076
- What...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

194
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,827
I was joking. I don't want any trouble.

195
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,829
- Tell your story walking.
- ...the...

196
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,749
shit was that?

197
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,251
I don't know! My instincts
just kicked in.

198
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,961
Why do you even have a gun?

199
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,714
Well, using it in the
movie was so empowering,

200
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,550
and now I just carry it everywhere.
Do you want to hold it?

201
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,511
No, I am very anti-gun.

202
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,013
In fact, I think the whole
idea of guns is inherently...

203
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:00,141
Holy shit, I'm holding a gun. How
long has this been in my hand?

204
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:03,561
- Slides right in, doesn't it?
- It actually feels kind of nice.

205
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,231
Would you like to try shooting it?
We can go to my gun range.

206
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,774
You have your own gun range?

207
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,111
I'm Courtney Portnoy. I
have all the things.

208
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,794
Whoa...

209
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,922
I can't believe you came back.

210
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:34,634
- Who, me? Or BoJack?
- You look just like him.

211
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,886
People tell me that.

212
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,810
Your mother's dementia
is progressing rapidly.

213
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,127
- You came out of nowhere.
- Yes.

214
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,476
I snuck up on you on purpose as a symbol
for the alarming creep of dementia.

215
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,563
- It isn't there, until it is.
- Thank you, very colorful.

216
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,440
We tried to call you, but
the number you gave us

217
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,896
connected to a sandwich
shop in Temecula.

218
00:10:51,921 --> 00:10:52,969
Is that right?

219
00:10:53,008 --> 00:10:54,946
This is the most responsive
she's been in weeks.

220
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,310
I think with regular visits
from you and your daughter...

221
00:10:57,334 --> 00:10:58,241
That's not happening.

222
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,164
Seeing my mom is like a
Terrence Malick movie.

223
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,603
Every ten years or so is bearable,

224
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,621
but more than that and it
starts to get annoying.

225
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,249
She won't last another ten years.

226
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,773
Well, I guess that's it, then. Bye, Mom!

227
00:11:07,797 --> 00:11:09,003
- Huh?
- Come on, Hollyhock,

228
00:11:09,074 --> 00:11:10,319
let's blow this Jell-O stand.

229
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,255
We're gonna come back though, right?

230
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,798
We can't just leave her like this.

231
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,800
You can do anything if
you believe in yourself.

232
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,552
- We have to come back.
- Henrietta?

233
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,720
- Every week.
- Why?

234
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,723
Because she's your mother
and dementia is hereditary.

235
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,434
One day, you're gonna be in a
home like this, and so will I,

236
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,686
and wouldn't you want
someone visiting you?

237
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,980
Fine. We'll come back. Happy?

238
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,441
Where's my orange juice, slag?

239
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:36,696
Ahhh!

240
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,034
Ahhh! See ya next week.

241
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,832
- Hey, are we out of milk?
- I can pick up some after work.

242
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,544
Great. Also, real quick follow-up,
why are you holding a gun?

243
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:52,629
Oh, my God!

244
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,798
Did I drive all the way home without
realizing I was holding a gun?

245
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,968
No wonder that guy at the gas station
didn't charge me for the Red Vines.

246
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,804
Did I rob a gas station?

247
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,806
Classic Diane shenanigans.

248
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,226
Or as I call them, "Diane-igans."
All right, be safe.

249
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:10,938
Hmm.

250
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,151
Let's get one thing
out of the way right now.

251
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,446
If you're a man, you're
not gonna get it.

252
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,782
Some of you think you get it.
You want to get it.

253
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,785
You listen, nod and say
all the right things

254
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,203
when we tell you our stories.

255
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,122
But you still can't actually
know what it feels like

256
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:31,209
to constantly have your guard up.

257
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,921
In parking garages, walking
the street, even at work.

258
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,423
I'm tired of trying to
help men understand

259
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,050
how it feels to be a woman.

260
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,094
Starting now, I'm doing what it takes

261
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,805
to put the power in my own hands.

262
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,057
That's why I own a gun.

263
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,899
- That was our senior picnic.
- Oh.

264
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,986
Oh, here I am. There's Polio Larry.

265
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,196
Yup, she sure remembers
all the important people.

266
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,999
- And who's this?
- That's my brother, Crackerjack.

267
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,534
That's not Crackerjack, that's me.

268
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,337
Thirty seconds after
that picture was taken

269
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,449
you yelled at me for getting
ice cream on my shorts.

270
00:13:08,473 --> 00:13:11,791
No ice cream for me, Henrietta.
I'm watching my figure.

271
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,460
Yeah, you want to look pretty
for when Death comes to visit.

272
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:15,712
Beth? No.

273
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,381
We stopped talking after she
wouldn't eat my casserole

274
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,509
and then I told the whole supper
club that her son was a gay.

275
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,152
- Ooh.
- Okay. You two enjoy each other.

276
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,555
I'm gonna go see if I can
seduce a lonely dowager

277
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,118
into giving me her night-night pills.

278
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,683
Wow. Is this you?

279
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:32,478
- This is me at my debutante ball.
- You were so beautiful.

280
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:36,065
You could be thin, too.
Just go easy on the sweets

281
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,193
and when you go somewhere,
don't walk, gallop.

282
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,237
Ice cold, Grammy-gram.

283
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,866
Morning time, Hollywoo!

284
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,659
I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.

285
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,453
And I'm A Billy Bush Type.

286
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,872
Here's something I'm just
now reading on a cue card.

287
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,499
All the ladies are getting
concealed carry permits.

288
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,751
It's the newest thing.

289
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,754
I wouldn't want to be
around one of those ladies

290
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,172
at a certain time of the month,
if you know what I mean.

291
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,965
I don't.

292
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,135
Joking aside, I think it's
great these gals have a hobby.

293
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:08,681
Oh, and I'm being told by our producers
that we have a breaking news alert...

294
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,225
There has been another mass shooting.

295
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:14,395
I am totally unqualified to cover
a news story this important.

296
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,523
But as a straight white male, I
will plow forward with confidence

297
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,942
and assume I'm doing fine.

298
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,280
Again with the crazy gunmen.

299
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,782
Princess Carolyn, if this keeps up,

300
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,784
we're gonna have to put
this movie on the shelf

301
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,912
next to that wacky vacation comedy
we did about the klutzy babysitter.

302
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,979
Ha! That sounds hilarious!

303
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:34,689
What the hell are you
doing on this call?

304
00:14:34,713 --> 00:14:36,918
Imagining that funny movie
you just described.

305
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,170
Okay, what do all these
shootings have in common?

306
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,839
Guns? Bullets? Who are you, Art
Linkletter? Just spit it out.

307
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:45,635
Men! What if we played up
the "Ms." in Ms. Taken?

308
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,387
In a world of increasing terror,

309
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,807
our movie tells women they don't
have to be afraid anymore.

310
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,059
- Yeah, now you're talking.
- When you put it that way,

311
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,024
it almost sounds like
these mass shootings

312
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:56,511
could be a good thing for the movie.

313
00:14:56,535 --> 00:14:59,315
No, no, no, of course not.
They're a terrible tragedy.

314
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,079
Thoughts and prayers
are with the victims.

315
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,693
- Right, thoughts and prayers.
- But...

316
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:07,490
anything that makes women feel unsafe
might actually help our box office.

317
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,378
But you don't want women to feel unsafe.

318
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:11,427
Of course not!

319
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,121
Nobody wants that, nobody's saying that.

320
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,665
But if they already do feel unsafe,

321
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,208
there's no reason not to capitalize.

322
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,293
Right, if they already
feel unsafe anyway.

323
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:22,338
Exactly, we're not
making them feel unsafe.

324
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:26,634
We're just profiting, albeit indirectly,
from there being more mass shootings.

325
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,346
In that case, I got good
news and I got bad news.

326
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,682
Bad news is you're gonna
want to avoid the 405.

327
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,978
- Ta-da!
- Ugh! Keep it down.

328
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,980
Why are you carrying
that thin hard book?

329
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,773
It's not a book, it's a DVD case.

330
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,733
We did a special episode
about elder care.

331
00:15:42,812 --> 00:15:45,212
Now we're gonna watch it and
learn how to handle this bitch.

332
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,696
When you say "this bitch",

333
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,031
do you mean your mom's
dementia or your mom?

334
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,950
I think you can pick
that up through context.

335
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,368
Season two, episode 12.

336
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,454
"I'm Ready For My Close-Up, Mr.
Dementia."

337
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:55,955
I'll go lie down.

338
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,500
- Hey, Ethan, who's your friend?
- Ethan made a friend?

339
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,711
This old man followed
me home from the park.

340
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,546
- Can I keep him?
- Aww.

341
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,425
Here we go, again.

342
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,968
- BoJack?
- Mom?

343
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,202
Hush, Henrietta. That's
my son on the television.

344
00:16:11,227 --> 00:16:12,236
You know him?

345
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:14,606
I think I'd know my own son, wouldn't I?

346
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,017
You heard the boss man.

347
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,896
Guess your daughter, the bikini model,
will have to pick you up at the park.

348
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,189
Daughter, the bikini model?

349
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,317
Whoa, whoa, Ethan,
this man is our guest!

350
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:28,905
Uh...

351
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,031
Huh.

352
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,872
- You know I hate guns, right?
- I know.

353
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,124
Although my official
stated political opinion

354
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,960
is I respect the Second Amendment
but I think some gun purchases

355
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,379
should require the barest
amount of background checks.

356
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,924
Mr. Peanutbutter, you
know I hate guns, too.

357
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,343
Or I thought I did. Or
I still do, mostly.

358
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:54,013
But being a gun owner finally makes me
feel as safe walking down the street

359
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,432
as a man gets to feel all the time.

360
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,143
And that's an incredible feeling
I'm not ready to give up yet.

361
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,812
If you can frack under our house,
I should get to have a gun.

362
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,064
All right, that's fair.

363
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,815
I'm really proud we've found a way

364
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,693
to keep our personal lives and our
political lives compartmentalized.

365
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:08,778
Me, too.

366
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,198
- You have no idea...
- Yes. I have no idea?

367
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,760
- Is your bubble of privilege so thick,
- What's with humans and guns?

368
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,244
You're addicted to these things.

369
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:19,038
And what is it with men and not
wanting women to feel safe?

370
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,599
- I don't...
- This is a gendered issue...

371
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:21,934
- Excuse me!
- ...make no mistake.

372
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,519
- I don't think women...
- You can't sympathize...

373
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,354
...running around with
guns makes anybody safer.

374
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,898
- Yeah. That's the danger.
- I don't...

375
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:27,964
- Excuse me.
- Not the men

376
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,884
who commit 90 percent of murders,
it's the crazy hysterical women

377
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:32,968
you gotta worry about!

378
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,808
Yes, yes! Fill my chamber
with your powerful bullets!

379
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,770
Beatrice, look who's back.

380
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,730
And we brought more Horsin' Around.

381
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:45,940
Oh? Good.

382
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,234
Because you love that BoJack, right?

383
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:52,446
Well, he's not much of a son, but the
show can be a comfort sometimes.

384
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,037
They were playing your dumb
show in his hospital room.

385
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:02,331
Which dumb show? New one or old one?

386
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,751
In the episode I saw, you walked
in on your daughter in the shower.

387
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,795
The old one. That episode got us

388
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,464
into the TV Guide "Cheers
and Jeers" column.

389
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:11,716
We did not get a "Cheers."

390
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,302
You always could play the fool, BoJack.

391
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:17,065
We have to have this conversation
now, on the way to Dad's funeral?

392
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,434
There was so much
more I wanted to say to him.

393
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,729
Well... you can forget it now.

394
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:34,322
And since you saw me naked,
that means I get to see you naked!

395
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:37,283
Something tells
me I'm gonna regret this.

396
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,120
Out of the way, hag, you're
blocking the screen.

397
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,371
Uh-huh.

398
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,671
I know this must be painful for you.

399
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,132
Not painful, boring. This place sucks.

400
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,426
If I'm not getting credit for
coming, what's the point?

401
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:59,388
If only there was some way for her
to connect the BoJack from the show

402
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,390
with the BoJack who
visits her every week.

403
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:05,853
- Yeah, too bad we can't. Or can we?
- Can we what?

404
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,731
Put on a live episode of Horsin'
Around in the nursing home.

405
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,274
- Good thinking, Hollyhock.
- Uh...

406
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,193
We'll do a Horsin'
Around here at the home.

407
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,070
She'll love it because
it's her son BoJack.

408
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,738
- Okay...
- Then after the show,

409
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,784
I'll come out and say hello. And
she'll say, "BoJack? Is that you?"

410
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,369
When her eyes spark with recognition,

411
00:19:21,444 --> 00:19:23,764
I'm gonna sit down next to her,
I'm gonna squeeze her hand

412
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,915
and get real close and say...

413
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,292
- "Fuck you, Mom."
- What?

414
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,711
I can finally tell her off!
I'm gonna say, "Look at you",

415
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:33,130
you old piece of shit,
rotting in a nursing home!"

416
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,758
- Now I have the power!
- That's what you want to say to her?

417
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,095
Oh, it's gonna be great! I can't
wait to see the look on her face.

418
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,390
Okay, let's do this.
Let's put on a show!

419
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,480
- Hey!
- Bad news.

420
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,283
Hear about the mass
shooting outside Tulsa?

421
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,109
Terrible tragedy. Thoughts and prayers.

422
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,486
We really have to do something
about these men who go...

423
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,738
No, P.C. This time it was a woman.

424
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:01,659
A woman mass shooter? Oh, no,
that really is bad news!

425
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,662
I just think this is what happens
when you give women guns.

426
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,288
They start shooting people with them.

427
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,416
I mean, do they even
know what guns are for?

428
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:11,627
I don't feel safe anymore walking
down my own street alone at night.

429
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:12,795
Me, a man!

430
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,715
I am convening a series
of congressional hearings

431
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,508
on the matter of women and guns.

432
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,845
Because even one death from the
bullet of a female gun owner

433
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,138
is too many.

434
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,598
What are my constituents supposed to do,

435
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:27,560
not compliment random
women on the street

436
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,270
because they might be carrying a gun?

437
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:33,566
We cannot allow our lives to be
dictated by that kind of fear.

438
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:38,112
So you see, the trigger was
specifically designed for a man's grip

439
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,156
and a man's temperament.

440
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,657
Look, all I'm saying is

441
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,785
maybe you shouldn't blame
women for wanting guns.

442
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,830
Maybe you should blame the
constant societal messaging

443
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:52,042
that tells us we are safe only as long
as the men around us allow us to be.

444
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,463
So if you have a problem with
women carrying firearms,

445
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,758
you can roll up your sleeves and
actually work to create a society

446
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:03,387
where women feel safe and equal,
or you can just ban all guns.

447
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,767
The ayes have it.

448
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,729
Possession of any firearm is now
illegal in the state of California.

449
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,813
We did it, boys.

450
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:13,920
- Huzzah!
- Yes!

451
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:15,892
- Congratulations!
- Fabulous!

452
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,444
I thought that was gonna
go the other way.

453
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:22,031
Wow, Diane. You just passed
sensible gun legislation.

454
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,159
I can't believe this country hates
women more than it loves guns.

455
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,243
No?

456
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,041
BoJack, I don't know about this.

457
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,293
You'll be fine. Just
remember to enunciate.

458
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,456
It helps if you imagine
performing for the back row.

459
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:39,048
- Not that. I mean...
- Shh! Here they come. Gladys, hit it!

460
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:47,515
Too bad I could never run for
president, 'cause I love waffling!

461
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:48,849
Wha... What is this?

462
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:51,352
Olivia, you usually love
my breakfast humor.

463
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,812
Why so glum, sugarplum?

464
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:56,232
It's this algebra homework
that gives me the blues.

465
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,442
X-axis? Y-axis?

466
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,903
Where's the 'Y'-should-I-care axis?

467
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,363
Henrietta, what are you doing?

468
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,989
BoJack, maybe we should stop.

469
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,450
We just started. Let's at least
get through the first act

470
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,661
before we judge ourselves
too harshly, huh?

471
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,163
I wonder if there's a
way to make math fun.

472
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,207
Math will never be fun.

473
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,506
The only thing I like,

474
00:22:14,544 --> 00:22:16,344
is rap music songs.

475
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,462
Make this stop. How do I turn this off?

476
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:22,007
Don't change it. I want to
see if this married couple

477
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,176
can work through their differences.

478
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,780
- Gimme the remote!
- This isn't right!

479
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:27,596
Guys, sharing is caring!

480
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,473
Oh, my God. Code red, code red!

481
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,595
What is happening? I don't like this!

482
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:32,685
No!

483
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,008
- Let go of me.
- Oh, God.

484
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:37,773
I am the heiress to the
Sugarman Sugarcube Company.

485
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,317
You can't do this to me!

486
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,406
I never get to watch what I want.

487
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,952
You think we should still
finish the episode, or...?

488
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:54,373
Our insurance policy is
very strict and very clear.

489
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,418
Once a resident becomes violent,
we can no longer house them.

490
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,003
Can you recommend another facility?

491
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,006
Frankly, at your mother's
rate of deterioration,

492
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,506
she probably doesn't have much time.

493
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,759
I recommend she spend it surrounded
by the people who care about her.

494
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,643
Okay, who are they? Do
you have their number?

495
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:09,923
I was referring to you
and your daughter.

496
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,368
- Oh. Uh...
- We'll take her.

497
00:23:11,415 --> 00:23:12,540
She can have the guest room,

498
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,269
and I can sleep on the couch. Right?

499
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,063
Okay. If she really doesn't
have much time left.

500
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,587
But if we get to this time next
year, she's still hanging on,

501
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,611
you will be getting a very
strongly worded letter, mister.

502
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,865
Excuse me, could you point me
in the direction of an H&M?

503
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,158
Sure.

504
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,410
That's all we got, once
we took out all the guns.

505
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,287
Maybe it could work
as an H&M commercial?

506
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,497
It's a shame. It was a great movie.

507
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,875
Yeah. Cut down in
the prime of its life.

508
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,210
Well, I'm very sorry for your loss.

509
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,421
Eh, I'll be fine.

510
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:48,469
Hey, Beatrice, you hungry?
I could make Pop-Tarts.

511
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,512
No, thank you.

512
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,140
You want to watch another
Horsin' Around episode?

513
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,433
What's the point?

514
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,352
Oh.

515
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,686
Oh, God.

516
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,864
I'm sorry you didn't get
to tell your mom off.

517
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,907
I keep thinking about all
the things I never said

518
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,189
because I was so sure there'd
be other days to say them.

519
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,704
- Why don't you tell her now?
- It's not the same.

520
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,828
I should have done it back
when she knew who I was,

521
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,249
back when it would mean something.

522
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,709
But now, she's gonna die

523
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,878
and she's never gonna know
just how much I hate her.

524
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,922
I'm sure she knew, BoJack.

525
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:28,050
- Yeah? You're not just saying that?
- She read your book, didn't she?

526
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,720
Yeah, but I really
wanted to say it to her face.

527
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:36,767
Well, hey, she's here now, right?
And she has good days and bad days.

528
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:41,939
Maybe, eventually, she'll recognize you.
And then you can totally rip into her.

529
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,732
- You really think so?
- Mm-hmm.
