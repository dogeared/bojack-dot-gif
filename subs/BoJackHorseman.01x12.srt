1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,379
When we booked you for this show,

2
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:06,840
you'd just won the Triple
Crown, but then just this week,

3
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:09,885
I open up the newspaper,
and look at this...

4
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:12,471
"Secretariat Under Investigation."

5
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:13,930
What am I supposed to do with that?

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,016
Maybe it's a different Secretariat.

7
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,310
Ha ha ha ha. No, but seriously, folks,

8
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:21,063
there is no truth to these allegations.

9
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,566
I have never bet on horse racing,

10
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:25,984
and I certainly did
not bet on my own races.

11
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:28,111
Although I did bet the
network's gonna give your show

12
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,488
back to Joey Bishop.

13
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:31,281
O... ho ho... kay.

14
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:34,159
We get letters here on the
show, and one particular letter,

15
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:37,413
for you, actually, struck
a chord with our producers.

16
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:40,499
This is from BoJack H.
BoJack is nine years old.

17
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,752
BoJack writes, "Dear Secretariat,

18
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,795
I am a horse just like you.

19
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,339
I like to watch racing, and
you are my favorite racer."

20
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:48,882
Smart kid.

21
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,634
"When I grow up, I want
to be just like you,

22
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,469
and I think I'm on the right track.

23
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:55,389
Get it? Track, because
horses run on tracks,

24
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,140
and you are a horse, and I am a horse.

25
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,602
Do you get it? Do you get
my joke about the track?"

26
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,604
Okay, there's a whole page of this.

27
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,480
Should I write him back
and tell him I get it?

28
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,566
He goes on, "My question for you is,

29
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,568
I am a good kid, and I like to play,

30
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,904
and I like to go to school,
but sometimes I get sad.

31
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,740
What do you do when you get sad?

32
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:15,451
How do you not be sad? Sincerely, BoJack."

33
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,202
That's a great letter.

34
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:20,497
BoJack, when I was your age, I got sad.

35
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,124
A lot.

36
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,794
I didn't come from such a great home,

37
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:28,297
but one day, I started running,
and that seemed to make sense,

38
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,549
so then I just kept running.

39
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:34,303
BoJack, when you get sad,
you run straight ahead

40
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,722
and you keep running
forward, no matter what.

41
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:38,557
There are people in your life

42
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:40,476
who are gonna try to hold
you back, slow you down,

43
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:41,769
but you don't let them.

44
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,229
Don't you stop running and
don't you ever look behind you.

45
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,565
There's nothing for you behind you.

46
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,652
All that exists is what's ahead.

47
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:53,739
Good morning, Louisville.
It's August 22nd, 1973.

48
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:56,158
A sad day for
the sport of horse racing.

49
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,453
Secretariat banned for
life from competition.

50
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,372
It's a disgrace is
what it is. This is the '70s.

51
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,458
You can't cheat in sports
and get away with it.

52
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,543
You know, I think
it just goes to show you,

53
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,962
you can be the fastest runner in the world,

54
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:12,966
but you can't outrun the truth.

55
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:17,095
And traffic is jammed
today coming into Louisville.

56
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,515
Looks like some idiot
parked his car on the bridge.

57
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:13,507
sync and corrrections by caioalbanezi
www.addic7ed.com

58
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:19,157
And the Golden Globe for
Best Comedy or Musical

59
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:22,745
goes to BoJack Horseman, my friend,

60
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:25,247
for his book One Trick Pony.

61
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,917
This is a first
win for BoJack Horseman

62
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,835
and his first appearance
at the Globe ceremony

63
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,379
since his forced removal in 1992

64
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,716
after he exchanged blows
with Sir Paul McCartney.

65
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,509
Wow, what an honor.

66
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,511
I have to thank the Hollywoo Foreign Press.

67
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:41,012
I feel like I should mention

68
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,890
that my book was not a comedy or a musical.

69
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,767
Do you guys actually watch
the movies you give awards to?

70
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,560
'Cause I kind of get the sense that...

71
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,562
Also, my book was not a
movie. You do know that, right?

72
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,397
We're friends.

73
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,608
Anyway, the response to this
book has been incredible.

74
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,360
These last three months
have been really amazing.

75
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,820
You know, a lot of people said to me,

76
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,614
"You sure you want to publish this book?

77
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,323
It's pretty personal."

78
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,367
And I said, "If I can make
just one person out there

79
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:05,036
feel a little less alone,
then it's all worth it."

80
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,289
And they said, "That's really brave."

81
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,959
And I said, "Well, I'm not
one to call myself brave,

82
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,127
but since you said it, yeah, I am."

83
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,255
After-party at my restaurant!

84
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,799
Why did I say after-party
at my restaurant?

85
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,801
I do not want to throw a party.

86
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:21,386
It did seem unlike you. I'm
gonna go get some cotton candy.

87
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,639
- You want some?
- No.

88
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:27,142
- Yes.
- There he is, man of the hour.

89
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,436
Hello, other grown up.

90
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,147
Cheer up, dummy. Your
book is a huge success.

91
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,817
Everybody loves you. You
just won a Golden Globe.

92
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,485
If you can't be happy tonight,

93
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,570
maybe you'll never be happy again.

94
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:40,238
I'm sorry, is that
supposed to be encouraging?

95
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,658
- Because it's super-bleak.
- Vincent Adultman...

96
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,994
how are things at the old nine to five?

97
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,329
Good. I went to the stock market today.

98
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,998
I did a business.

99
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,874
I keep telling him he works too hard.

100
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,335
Come on, Vincent, let's
get away from the rat race.

101
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,546
Take a cruise someplace wet and Latin.

102
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,841
I mean, can you imagine
this body in a swimsuit?

103
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,259
- I literally cannot.
- Vincent, let's do a lap.

104
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,803
Have you met Brendan Fraser?

105
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,805
I feel like you two would love each other.

106
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,181
Whoa. Easy, easy.

107
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,017
I got to hand it to Diane.

108
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,310
This book has been everything
she said it would be.

109
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,187
Yeah, she knows what she's doing.

110
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,023
How is Diane? I haven't seen her since...

111
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,232
Well, I haven't seen her in a while.

112
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,276
Well, the book's
been huge for her, too.

113
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,362
She's practically as famous as I am now.

114
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,781
- We're like the Brangelinas.
- Well, I'm happy she's happy.

115
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:25,575
- And how are you?
- Well, it's been really hard...

116
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:29,079
Erica, is that you? Who let
you out of the burn ward?

117
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,164
Get over here, you.

118
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,835
Excuse me. I just have to tell
you how much I love your book.

119
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:38,380
It's so naked and honest and revealing.

120
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,882
It is? .

121
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,633
I love the part about how you became famous

122
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:43,927
so you could be constantly
surrounded by distraction

123
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,888
and wouldn't have to
be alone with yourself.

124
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,890
I thought that was a
really profound observation.

125
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,516
Yeah, definitely. So profound.

126
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,434
- Do you want to get out of here?
- What?

127
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,020
Come back to my place, maybe
get a little more naked,

128
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:56,565
- honest and revealing?
- No. No, thanks.

129
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,441
- What about you?
- Yeah, okay.

130
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:05,323
Whoa.

131
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,080
- Hey, Diane.
- You still friends with BoJack?

132
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,748
Heard you two were on the outs.

133
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,374
You gonna write another book about it?

134
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,043
You looking at some oranges?

135
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,003
You gonna write a book
about those oranges?

136
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,673
- Hello.
- Diane.

137
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,383
Sebastian St. Claire here,

138
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,635
famed billionaire
philanthropist/adventurer.

139
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,721
Please, hold your applause.

140
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,140
- Okay.
- You can applaud a little.

141
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,059
Okay.

142
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,269
I got your number from Pinky Penguin.

143
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,396
I'm looking for a journalist
to follow me around

144
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,899
for a few months and
document my daring exploits

145
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:42,027
aiding ravaged communities
and displaced people.

146
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:45,321
- Ssss.
- Wow, that sounds amazing.

147
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,617
But that's not usually the
kind of thing I write about.

148
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,080
Diane, if you can make people
care about BoJack Horseman,

149
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:56,207
surely you can make them
care about emaciated orphans

150
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,709
with missing limbs.

151
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,211
We need to wake people up.

152
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,005
Well, I am a morning person.

153
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,174
I hope you mean mourning with a "u,"

154
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,510
because, Diane, this is deadly serious.

155
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,179
Yes, of course.

156
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,143
You want to spend three months in Sudan?

157
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,561
Not just there. We're also
going to Haiti and Thailand

158
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,688
and Uganda and Chechnya.

159
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,398
Can't you do all that in L.A.?

160
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,275
I want to do something important.

161
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,361
I want to help people and do good work

162
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,573
and sleep on the ground
and poop in a bucket.

163
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,951
Honey, nobody wants to poop in a bucket.

164
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,912
Maybe I do. Maybe I
want to poop in a bucket.

165
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:36,456
If you want to poop in a
bucket, we can get you a bucket.

166
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,583
You don't have to go all
the way the Chechnylavakia.

167
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,960
Am I saying that right?

168
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,837
It's not just the pooping in a bucket.

169
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,839
I think it might be good
for me to get out of L.A.

170
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,090
for a little bit.

171
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:47,843
Sweetie, you know I support
you, whatever you want to do,

172
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,761
but you're not gonna find
what you're looking for

173
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,805
in these awful made-up places.

174
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,724
The universe is a cruel, uncaring void.

175
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,144
The key to being happy
isn't a search for meaning.

176
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:00,355
It's to just keep yourself
busy with unimportant nonsense,

177
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,482
and eventually, you'll be dead.

178
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:06,153
Well, I guess I can keep my options open.

179
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,237
Great.

180
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,201
Hey, can I ask you something?

181
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:15,954
Did Vincent seem extra
weird to you last night?

182
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,748
Well, he's still three kids
in a trench coat, so, no.

183
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,292
We're going through a rough
patch. It's hard, you know.

184
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,294
He's works a full time job
at the business factory,

185
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,921
so when he gets home,

186
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,132
he just wants to unwind
by watching R-rated movies.

187
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:29,425
I thought I was ready
for a real adult relationship,

188
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,844
but...

189
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,471
Enough about me. BoJack, you are on fire.

190
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,515
Are we talking about me again?

191
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,018
We have an offer on the table
for you to play the bad guy

192
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,477
in the new James Bond.

193
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,813
I agree. Total garbage.

194
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,524
But this, it's a new drama
from the Coen Brothers.

195
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,069
A western about a one-horse
town and you're the horse.

196
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,571
Hello, Oscar. What do you think?

197
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,948
I think now's the time to
finally make "Secretariat."

198
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,451
Really? Now? Aren't you a
little, um, very too old?

199
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,495
You asked me what I wanted
to do. That's what I want.

200
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,873
That's all I've ever wanted,
and if I can't get it now,

201
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,209
then all of this has been for nothing.

202
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,919
Fish. Of course!

203
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,837
Why would you ever make things easy for me

204
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,548
when instead you could make
things incredibly difficult?

205
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,675
Laura, clear out the rest of my day.

206
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,552
I have to push a boulder up a hill,

207
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,846
and then have it roll
over me time and time again

208
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,848
with no regard for my well-being.

209
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:17,933
Attagirl.

210
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:22,229
All right, Todd. PB
Livin' needs a new project.

211
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,607
Bi-Monthly Curated Box of Snacks
has been an enormous success,

212
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,984
but I got into this game to make movies,

213
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,611
so let's make a movie.

214
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,446
Well, I got a stack of great scripts here.

215
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,073
Any one of them would
make a wonderful movie.

216
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,699
Fantastic.

217
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:38,828
But I also have this other
non-movie-related idea.

218
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,330
Ooh, let's hear the other idea.

219
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,082
Okay. I was heading down Wilshire,

220
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:45,210
and I saw this empty
store front, and I thought,

221
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,212
"You know what this world needs?"

222
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,880
Edge of my seat over here.

223
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:52,592
A store where people
can buy Halloween stuff.

224
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,470
Halloween store. Feel
like that's been done.

225
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,388
Yeah, in October,

226
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:00,934
but how come your never see
a Halloween store in January?

227
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,228
- It's an untapped market.
- Yeah.

228
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:05,605
A Halloween store that's open year-round.

229
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,108
- No, no. Just January.
- Brilliant.

230
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,153
That's the kind of idea
that wins Golden Globes.

231
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,158
I actually think the time
is right for "Secretariat,"

232
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,451
so what do you want to
play, like, Secretariat's dad

233
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,204
or his grandfather, maybe
like an elderly witch doctor

234
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,206
who puts a curse on him or something?

235
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,458
Lenny, look, I know I'm a
little long in the tooth,

236
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,252
but I think that you more than anyone

237
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,629
would know not to count out an old pro.

238
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,464
Don't play the ageism card with me, kid.

239
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,883
I've laid farts that lasted
longer than your entire career.

240
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:37,137
But Secretariat was dead at
27, so who we kidding here?

241
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,097
Just set the project up
and give me an audition.

242
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,598
- That's all I ask.
- All right.

243
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,100
You got yourself a "go" picture, kid.

244
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:44,102
And by you, I mean me. And by "go" picture,

245
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,355
I mean I'll make some phone
calls, we'll see what I can do.

246
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,649
And by kid, I mean middle-aged adult.

247
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,695
Shh. No, no, no.
Put it here. Put it here.

248
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,031
- Okay, I'll do it.
- Ahem.

249
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:59,326
- Has this ever happened to you?
- Has what ever happened to me?

250
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,371
- Todd?
- Yes, Mr. Peanutbutter?

251
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,373
What's going on? Why are
you talking like that?

252
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,333
Todd, I just got a phenomenal idea

253
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,043
for a Halloween costume.

254
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,170
Why don't you and I dash
over to the store right quick

255
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,547
and spend some hard-earned American money?

256
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,508
But, Mr. Peanutbutter, didn't you hear?

257
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,511
It's January, and the
Halloween store won't open

258
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,139
for another nine months.

259
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:23,599
But I want satisfaction now.

260
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,977
Has this ever happened to you?

261
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,021
Not to anyone ever at any time.

262
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,774
Ahem. We give you Halloween in January,

263
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,903
a truly immersive Halloween experience

264
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,030
for the rest of us.

265
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,741
Halloween in January? Please elaborate.

266
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,993
Okay, but before I do, tell the audience.

267
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:44,329
- Have we ever met before?
- Never.

268
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:48,083
Well, according to facts,
there's more suicides in January

269
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,668
- than any other month.
- I'm getting pretty close over here.

270
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:54,756
Also, there's less Halloween
stores. Coincidence?

271
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,385
Wow, I'm convinced. This
store could save lives.

272
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,262
Unbelievable. When your powers combine...

273
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:03,848
you are somehow even more stupid
than the sum of your stupids.

274
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,641
- Thank you.
- Go on.

275
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,103
You stop encouraging him
and you stop encouraging him.

276
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,896
The two of you are playing with fire.

277
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,190
A fire called Having a Good Idea.

278
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,943
Or maybe a fire called Friendship.

279
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,862
- Fires aren't called things.
- What about the Chicago fire?

280
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,239
Or Fire Island.

281
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,990
- Or Gabe.
- Who's Gabe?

282
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,951
Just a fire I met once. Named him Gabe.

283
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,953
- He sounds delightful.
- He was. Good guy.

284
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,796
Business, business, business.
Is that all you ever think about?

285
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,089
I don't know.

286
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,091
What's under that coat, Vincent?

287
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,802
- You need to let me in.
- Not right now.

288
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,678
I have to call the guy at the office

289
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,722
and take the car to the place.

290
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,475
It's always guys in places with you.

291
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,768
You know, I thought I
wanted to date a real adult,

292
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,853
but I'm actually young at heart.

293
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,189
I need to feel the grass between my toes.

294
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,733
I want to wear jeans. I want to dance.

295
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,944
- That's baby stuff.
- No, Vincent.

296
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,655
There's more to being an adult
than just work and business

297
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,741
and the tall-person rides at
Disneyland. I want to have fun.

298
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,828
There has to be a difference
between monogamy and monotony.

299
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,247
What's mahumanunny?

300
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,249
Well, clearly we had a
different understanding

301
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,251
of what this was.

302
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,212
I'd like to be an adult about
this, but frankly, I'm hurt.

303
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,924
I think you should just go,
just git. Get out of my life.

304
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,592
Okay.

305
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,178
Okay.

306
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:26,264
Could I have another soda?

307
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,270
BoJack, you know Kelsey
Jannings, our director.

308
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,523
I really appreciate you
giving me this opportunity.

309
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,065
Yeah.

310
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,818
Secretariat was kind of my hero as a kid.

311
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,820
Yeah, he was a lot of people's hero.

312
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,698
Well, you know, here was
a guy who had everything...

313
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,783
Yeah, I know the story. I'm the director.

314
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,702
Kelsey, be nice.

315
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,745
She's just cranky because
she's already seen 30 people

316
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,582
read for this today, and
we are all so goddamn sick

317
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,792
of seeing auditions, so
whenever you're ready.

318
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,169
Just jump right in.

319
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,296
Great. Let's get to it.

320
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,590
Hey, ain't you that horse

321
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,259
- that won all them races?
- Not today, ma'am.

322
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,679
Today I'm just a customer
who wants a warm slice of pie.

323
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,515
Can I ask you a question?

324
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,517
When you're out there
on that there racetrack,

325
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,768
- what are you running from?
- You want to know the truth?

326
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,396
Nothing.

327
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,647
Everyone's running from something, sugar.

328
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:20,735
No, I'm running from nothing.
I'm terrified of nothing.

329
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,820
People come up to me,
they want my autograph,

330
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,239
they want my picture.

331
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:27,033
They think they recognize something in me,

332
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:30,119
and I want to be that person
they think I am, but I'm not.

333
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,705
They see a greatness in me, and
they mistake it for goodness,

334
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,750
but I... I know there's nothing there.

335
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:40,880
As fast as I run, I
can't get way from that.

336
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,465
Wow.

337
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,885
BoJack, I think I speak
for everyone when I say...

338
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,931
My God, Andrew Garfield said yes.

339
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,767
- We have our Secretariat.
- We got Andrew Garfield?

340
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,227
My God, it's the best day of my life.

341
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,853
You don't say no to Spider-Man.

342
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,105
This movie is gonna be amazing.

343
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,314
Andrew...

344
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,443
Garfield!

345
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:04,404
Now, the pills will give you nightmares...

346
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,696
I mean, just horrifying...

347
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,698
but the malaria will give you death,

348
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:10,076
so you're going to want
to take the pills, Diane.

349
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,702
Hold on.

350
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:16,040
A mosquito got into my
tent. What do you want?

351
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,293
Hello?

352
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,629
Diane, it's Princess
Carolyn, BoJack's agent.

353
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,255
Yeah, I know who you are.

354
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,340
I'm the pink cat, the one
who used to date BoJack.

355
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,135
We've met a lot of times.
You came to my wedding.

356
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,637
Listen, the Turteltaub Company

357
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,639
is making a movie about Secretariat.

358
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,515
And since you're such an expert,

359
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,685
they want to bring you on
board as a character consultant.

360
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,437
What does that mean?

361
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,063
It's the cushiest job in the world.

362
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,982
You sit in a fancy chair
and eat pastries all day.

363
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,943
And then once a week, you say,
"Secretariat wouldn't do that."

364
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,070
I don't know. I've already
been offered this other thing.

365
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,323
And did you know there
are orphans in Sudan...

366
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,325
You take this job, you can
buy all the orphans you want.

367
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,160
No, I don't want to buy them.

368
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,162
Look, if you really want to help people,

369
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,289
it doesn't hurt to have a
little money in your pocket.

370
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,500
Take the job now, help the orphans later.

371
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,835
There's always later.

372
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,211
Okay, talk it over with your husband.

373
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,005
I got to go get my whiskers trimmed.

374
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,258
I run into walls for days, but I look hot.

375
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,262
- How's the pie here?
- Not good.

376
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,888
Well, I'll take all you got.

377
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,683
Screw it. Throw it in
a bowl with some bourbon

378
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,934
- and bring me a
ladle. -

379
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:20,771
BoJack, we notice you've been
pretty down in the dumps lately,

380
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:24,651
but we have something that we
think is going to cheer you up.

381
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,695
It's an exciting new business venture

382
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,071
that's equal parts new and exciting.

383
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,782
Another one? What happened
to your Halloween store?

384
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,284
- What now?
- Right.

385
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,161
The Halloween store.

386
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,079
We took the floor out

387
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,708
because Mr. Peanutbutter kept
scratching up the hardwood,

388
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,585
and then... Did we ever
get the new floor installed?

389
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,755
Halloween? In January?

390
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,341
What a great ide... Aah!

391
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,428
Anyway, now we're all about smoodies.

392
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,597
- What?
- Smoodies.

393
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,307
You're saying smoothies, right? Smoothies.

394
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,892
No. Smoodies.

395
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,645
It's a mood that you drink like a smoothie.

396
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:03,481
I don't understand it.
How do you drink a mood?

397
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,775
- Like a smoothie.
- So it is a smoothie.

398
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,612
No, it's a smoodie...
A mood that you drink.

399
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:13,324
- How do you drink a mood?
- Like a smoothie.

400
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:16,578
But do you buy it in a store?
What're the physical attributes?

401
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,580
We haven't worked out all the kinks yet,

402
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,582
but the important thing
is we've gone public,

403
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,751
and we want you to get
in on the ground floor.

404
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,669
See, that's the problem
with all your ideas...

405
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:26,755
they don't have ground floors.

406
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:30,925
Finally, a Halloween store
for the rest of... Aah!

407
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,387
Hello.

408
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,972
Anyway, our launch party's tonight,

409
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,684
- and we'd love it if you came.
- We spared no expense...

410
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,936
that's how confident we are in our product.

411
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,521
- Your product... Smoodies.
- Yes.

412
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:46,315
Wait, did you say smoodies or smoothies?

413
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,443
Because we only make...
Which one do we make?

414
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,903
I'd like to think the smoodies make us.

415
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:55,116
I can tell by your tone
that that was something smart.

416
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,747
- Smoodie keychain?
- Smoodie cozy?

417
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,164
Smoodie bottle opener?

418
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,417
It's a mood that you drink like a smoothie.

419
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,419
Todd, it is all happening.

420
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,964
Hooray. And you know I don't
throw that word around lightly.

421
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,425
All right. Now we just
got to make sure we focus

422
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,385
and actually follow through on this.

423
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:17,012
I'd feel awful if this
great idea fell apart

424
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,307
because we got distracted
by something else,

425
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,850
as we are often wont to do.

426
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,687
Wait, did you say you
feel awful or falafel?

427
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,439
I said, "Feel awful,"

428
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,609
but tell me more about this falafel idea.

429
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,737
Falafel or fawaffle?

430
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:34,113
What?

431
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:44,290
BoJack, isn't this
exciting? Smoodies, right?

432
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,835
Do you even know what a smoodie is?

433
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,837
I think it's some kind of an adult onesie.

434
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,963
Whatever it is, I'm trying new things.

435
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,591
I'm single again, and I'm loving it.

436
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:56,594
- Let me repeat...
- Princess Carolyn.

437
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:59,806
Vincent. Well, you've got
some nerve showing your face.

438
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:03,184
- I've got half a mind to...
- No, let me talk.

439
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,145
I had a attitude problem,

440
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,314
but then I took a timeout,

441
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,232
and I thought about what I did.

442
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,360
I wanted to be a big man.

443
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:17,699
But sometimes the biggest thing
a man can do is tell the truth.

444
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:21,118
And the truth about me is, I... I...

445
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,829
- Okay, here we go.
- I love you.

446
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,955
- What?
- Vincent.

447
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,083
Let's go feel grass between our toes.

448
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,044
- What?
- All right.

449
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,213
You're a better man than I could ever be.

450
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,006
I wish my boyfriend was that mature.

451
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,135
- Hello?
- BoJack, it's Kelsey Jannings.

452
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,888
I got some news about "Secretariat."

453
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,264
- What's up?
- Garfield's out.

454
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,058
He got into some sort of accident.

455
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,268
An All Hallows' Eve store in January?

456
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,564
How fiendishly droll. Aah!

457
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,650
Bother.

458
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:54,777
The clumsy bastard broke
every bone in his body,

459
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,654
and now we got to find a new lead.

460
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:58,823
Studio wants to go young,
but I was thinking we'd get

461
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:01,784
someone a little more BoJack Horseman.

462
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,703
What? Are you serious?

463
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,747
You're the only one with
enough grit to play the part,

464
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,207
and we can age you down in
post, but I'm gonna tell you now,

465
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,501
not gonna put up with
any woe-is-me bullshit

466
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:12,127
or diva histrionics.

467
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,796
I get enough of that from my ex-wife

468
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,173
along with newspaper
clippings about gluten.

469
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,593
God, we get it, Marla. Gluten.

470
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,011
But if you want to make a movie,
and you're ready to work...

471
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,389
I am. I will. I can. I do.

472
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,974
Great. You got one month to get in shape.

473
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,268
You need to lose 50 pounds
and then gain back 20.

474
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,895
- And, BoJack...
- Yeah?

475
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,730
Don't ever call this number.

476
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,356
If I want to talk, I'll call you.

477
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,905
- Hey.
- Hey.

478
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,573
Not big on parties?

479
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,825
Nah. I never know what to do with my hands.

480
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,327
I think I just got cast in Secretariat.

481
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,456
- That's amazing.
- It's everything I ever wanted.

482
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,751
- Yeah, you seem super-jazzed.
- What do I do now?

483
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:54,336
Well, that's the problem with life, right?

484
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,839
Either you know what you want,
and you don't get what you want,

485
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,425
or get what you want, and then
you don't know what you want.

486
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,177
- Well, that's stupid.
- Yeah.

487
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,221
I don't know if this makes
you more or less excited,

488
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:06,933
but I actually decided to take
a job on the Secretariat movie

489
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,977
as a character consultant.

490
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:11,896
Wow, so we're gonna be
working together again.

491
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,898
Yeah. I hope you don't get sick of me.

492
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,691
I don't think that's gonna happen.

493
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,360
- Is it weird I took this job?
- Why would it be weird?

494
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,822
You literally wrote
the book on Secretariat.

495
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:24,533
Yeah, I know. I just...
When I first moved to L.A...

496
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,495
I thought I was gonna be
doing really important work.

497
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,831
You know, writing stuff
that makes a difference.

498
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:33,042
But then you kind of fall into
one thing and then another...

499
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,294
Well, you've got time.
There's always later, right?

500
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,254
Yeah, I guess there's always later.

501
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,381
Do you remember the last time I saw you?

502
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,176
You asked me if I thought you
were a good person deep down?

503
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:45,054
Do I remember that? Yeah, vaguely.

504
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,598
You caught me off guard.
I didn't know what to say.

505
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:51,602
Well, do you think I'm a
good person... deep down?

506
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:54,229
That's the thing. I don't
think I believe in deep down.

507
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,733
I kind of think all you are
is just the things that you do.

508
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,862
Well, that's depressing.

509
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,697
For what it's worth,

510
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,615
I think your writing
does make a difference.

511
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:06,158
Thanks.

512
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,577
I really wanted you to like me, Diane.

513
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,412
I know.

514
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:14,143
Sorry we didn't
get you a birthday present.

515
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,228
I got so distracted by
trying to get tickets

516
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,272
to the New Kids On The Block concert,

517
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,983
I completely lost sight
of what's important.

518
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,986
And I got so swept up in my
campaign for class president,

519
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,906
I forgot why I was
running in the first place.

520
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,908
And I was boy crazy.

521
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,035
Kids, kids, I don't need a present.

522
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,245
I got everything I need right here.

523
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,413
Aww.

524
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:37,458
- Macaroni.
- Sabrina.

525
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,668
Come here, you goofball.

526
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:55,851
- Aha.
- Whoa.

527
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,603
Can you make it out to Blake?

528
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,106
Thanks, man. You're, like, my hero.

529
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,399
Really?
