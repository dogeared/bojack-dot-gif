1
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:12,655
So, at the end of the day,

2
00:00:12,738 --> 00:00:15,324
I'm just a regular guy trying
to live a regular life.

3
00:00:15,407 --> 00:00:18,577
Remember that time you peed
in Drew Barrymore's car?

4
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:21,622
Uh, yes, I remember that.
Why do you remember that?

5
00:00:21,706 --> 00:00:23,123
It was in your book.

6
00:00:23,207 --> 00:00:26,126
-You should do that to someone here.
-What? No.

7
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,006
Well, anyway, I can't believe
I'm on a date with BoJack Horseman.

8
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:33,133
I feel like that anonymous girl
from Chapter 8 of your book

9
00:00:33,258 --> 00:00:36,095
mixed with the pluck and determination
of that anonymous girl

10
00:00:36,178 --> 00:00:39,223
-from Chapter 12.
-We don't need to dwell on the past.

11
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:41,517
Wait, shut up.
Is this the restaurant you bought

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,603
when you were trying
to show up Mr. Peanutbutter?

13
00:00:44,687 --> 00:00:47,314
-Uh... No.
-Hey, this table's a little wobbly.

14
00:00:47,398 --> 00:00:49,400
Want to yell at the waiter
and make a scene?

15
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:52,070
-No, I don't need--
-Come on, do that BoJack thing

16
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,363
where you make a big deal
and everyone laughs,

17
00:00:54,446 --> 00:00:55,948
but at the same time we relate,

18
00:00:56,032 --> 00:00:58,659
because you're saying
the things polite society won't.

19
00:00:58,743 --> 00:00:59,744
That's not-- Ugh...

20
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:03,330
-Is everything all right over here?
-No, everything is not all right.

21
00:01:03,414 --> 00:01:05,416
This table's been wobbling all evening.

22
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:09,045
If I wanted to flop around and get seasick
for an hour, I'd call your mother.

23
00:01:09,128 --> 00:01:12,006
-Something in that area or...?
-Take me home now

24
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,467
and don't let me get out of bed
until I turn horse-colored.

25
00:01:17,095 --> 00:01:19,179
-What are you doing?
-Did you want me to stay?

26
00:01:19,263 --> 00:01:21,099
No, I wanted you to leave more quietly.

27
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,517
Some of us here are trying
to forget you exist.

28
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:25,937
"Forget you exist."
Classic BoJack. Love it.

29
00:01:27,646 --> 00:01:30,733
- Oh, my God, are you Todd?
- Uh, yes.

30
00:01:30,816 --> 00:01:32,151
"Shut up, Todd!"

31
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:35,487
Aw, okay.

32
00:02:33,712 --> 00:02:35,881
Hey, Todd, can you drive me
to get my car?

33
00:02:35,965 --> 00:02:38,717
I wanted to be responsible last night,
so I Ubered home

34
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:41,053
-and left my car in the fountain.
-Sorry, BoJack.

35
00:02:41,179 --> 00:02:46,475
I gotta get ready for my grand opening.
It's finally happening. My Disneyland.

36
00:02:46,558 --> 00:02:49,812
I realize that by saying "what"
I might set off a chain of events

37
00:02:49,895 --> 00:02:52,356
whereby we continue this conversation,
but what?

38
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,193
Well, remember when I first moved in
and I kept asking

39
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,277
-if we could go to Disneyland?
-I do not.

40
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:59,989
And then you said
that there was no Disneyland.

41
00:03:00,072 --> 00:03:02,825
-No.
-That Disneyland was a made-up lie,

42
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:06,245
like the tooth fairy, that parents use
to get their kids to behave.

43
00:03:06,328 --> 00:03:08,914
-Oh, yeah, that shut you up.
-Sure did.

44
00:03:08,998 --> 00:03:12,501
But then I thought,
why isn't there a Disneyland?

45
00:03:12,584 --> 00:03:13,752
People would love it!

46
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:16,047
So, I took matters into my own hands,

47
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,800
and over the last five years,
I built my own Disneyland.

48
00:03:19,884 --> 00:03:23,428
You've been doing this for five years?
How have you never mentioned it?

49
00:03:23,554 --> 00:03:27,558
I bought that cheap plot of non-arable
dirt by the toxic waste dump

50
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:30,519
-up the hill from the old fire station.
-Okay, Todd.

51
00:03:30,602 --> 00:03:33,647
-I'm gonna build a Disneyland.
-Sounds great, champ.

52
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:36,234
If it wasn't for that,
she never would've gotten sober.

53
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:39,904
Just finished drawing up blueprints
for that Disneyland I'm building.

54
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:41,239
Kind of busy here, Todd.

55
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,991
So, it turned out to be a good thing
I peed in her car.

56
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:45,993
Sorry for all the noise.

57
00:03:46,077 --> 00:03:49,914
Got this crew of worker bees
to help me build my Disneyland.

58
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:53,500
Okay, I get it. You are building
your own Disneyland.

59
00:03:53,584 --> 00:03:57,671
-Literally the first I'm hearing of this.
-Anyway, tomorrow we open the gates.

60
00:03:57,755 --> 00:04:02,218
Finally, people will have a place to go
after they win the Super Bowl.

61
00:04:02,301 --> 00:04:04,678
But you do know
that there already is a Disneyland?

62
00:04:04,803 --> 00:04:07,806
-Yeah, I built it.
-No, I mean the real Disneyland.

63
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,893
You mean, the one in the hearts
and minds of children everywhere?

64
00:04:10,976 --> 00:04:13,771
-The one in Anaheim!
-I think we're saying the same thing.

65
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,189
Are we?

66
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:20,861
Well, I think it's safe
to take the cone off.

67
00:04:20,945 --> 00:04:23,281
I can do it for a small co-pay.

68
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,740
Can't say I'll miss it,

69
00:04:24,823 --> 00:04:29,203
but we did have some crazy adventures
together these last few weeks.

70
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:34,292
Honey, would you rub my chin for me
so I can remember things?

71
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,294
Oh, um, okay. Uh...

72
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,921
Yeah, memories.

73
00:04:39,004 --> 00:04:42,174
Hey, where should we go for my first meal
after the operation?

74
00:04:42,258 --> 00:04:44,885
It's not an operation,
but we could go to Storky's again.

75
00:04:44,969 --> 00:04:48,180
Oh, yeah! We're finally due
for our free sub.

76
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:51,642
"Storky's,
where your 81st sandwich is free."

77
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:55,020
We've been there 80 times?
It just opened last month.

78
00:04:55,104 --> 00:04:58,816
Yeah, but you love it, so whenever
you suggest it, I always say yes.

79
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,485
Yeah, but 80 times?

80
00:05:02,153 --> 00:05:05,447
Well, that'll be $6000.

81
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,367
Good thing you're getting
a free sandwich, huh?

82
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:12,371
What the...?

83
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,000
Huh?

84
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:20,420
Okay, you guys.
You vultures are killing me!

85
00:05:20,504 --> 00:05:23,048
I'm sure he's talking about
other vultures.

86
00:05:25,843 --> 00:05:27,636
Ah, the Valley.

87
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,514
Because sometimes you wanna go
where no one knows your name.

88
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:34,518
- BoJack Horseman!
- Pinky? Hey, how are you?

89
00:05:36,228 --> 00:05:37,396
Oh, great!

90
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:39,273
-How's the book biz?
-Who knows?

91
00:05:39,357 --> 00:05:43,319
I jumped off that burning ship.
Print media? What a joke.

92
00:05:43,402 --> 00:05:46,571
Now I got a job
in broadcast network television,

93
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:50,993
a booming industry
with nowhere to go but up.

94
00:05:51,076 --> 00:05:52,328
Oh, God.

95
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:55,080
-What are you doing here?
-Oh, my boss loves this place.

96
00:05:55,164 --> 00:05:57,249
Do you know Wanda Pierce?

97
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:00,336
Wanda just got named head
of programming at MBN.

98
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:01,753
We're here to celebrate.

99
00:06:01,837 --> 00:06:04,882
Well, that and she just woke up
from a 30-year coma.

100
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,301
Wait, she just got out
of a 30-year coma

101
00:06:07,385 --> 00:06:10,554
and she's the head of programming
at a major broadcast network?

102
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:14,766
She's been with the company 30 years.
Everyone above her kept getting fired.

103
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,186
Besides, she's got
some really fresh ideas.

104
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:20,147
I am really feeling
The Kirk Cameron Show.

105
00:06:20,231 --> 00:06:23,192
I don't even need a pilot.
Let's just order 22 episodes.

106
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:27,696
How about a new show
where celebrities try to guess

107
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:29,448
whether or not people have talent?

108
00:06:29,531 --> 00:06:31,158
We'll air it three nights a week.

109
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:36,372
Okay, what if we got relevant superstar
David Copperfield

110
00:06:36,455 --> 00:06:39,791
to make
the World Trade Center disappear?

111
00:06:40,584 --> 00:06:43,212
I hate to be the one to tell you this,

112
00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:46,631
but David Copperfield really isn't
a big draw anymore.

113
00:06:46,715 --> 00:06:49,134
Actually, everything feels fresh

114
00:06:49,218 --> 00:06:51,762
if you just forget
the last 30 years ever happened.

115
00:06:51,887 --> 00:06:52,971
Huh.

116
00:06:53,055 --> 00:06:54,765
And here's a special request.

117
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:56,225
I've never even heard of this song,

118
00:06:56,308 --> 00:06:59,186
"Special Feeling."

119
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,856
Wanda, meet
the one and only BoJack Horseman.

120
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,400
-Who?
-BoJack.

121
00:07:04,483 --> 00:07:05,984
-Who?
-BoJack Horseman.

122
00:07:06,068 --> 00:07:08,195
Is that name supposed
to mean something to me?

123
00:07:14,243 --> 00:07:16,912
-Do you want to go skate?
-Nah. You know what they say,

124
00:07:16,995 --> 00:07:19,790
you can lead a horse to roller,
but you can't make him rink.

125
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,002
-What?
-That's really funny.

126
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:25,379
-You're funny.
-Really?

127
00:07:25,463 --> 00:07:27,547
Oh, my God. You should be on TV,

128
00:07:27,631 --> 00:07:29,883
which, holy shit, they're flat now.

129
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:33,512
Actually, I was on. You know what,
I'm sick of talking about me.

130
00:07:33,637 --> 00:07:35,764
Let's talk about you.

131
00:07:41,103 --> 00:07:44,022
Next thing I know,
I'm waking up from a 30-year coma.

132
00:07:44,106 --> 00:07:47,443
So, now I'm sleeping on my sister's couch,
but it's not ideal.

133
00:07:47,526 --> 00:07:50,237
She's molting.
You know how sisters are.

134
00:07:50,321 --> 00:07:53,782
Oh, jeez, got a couple curly guys in here
with the regulars.

135
00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:56,576
How hard is it to look
before they bring it out?

136
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,996
-Excuse me, miss?
-I know, isn't it cool?

137
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,373
-Like we're getting away with something.
-What?

138
00:08:01,457 --> 00:08:04,626
Don't you love it when appetizers have
a little crossover episode?

139
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:07,546
It's like when you're watching
Happy Days and Mork shows up.

140
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:09,089
Oh, yeah, I guess.

141
00:08:09,173 --> 00:08:11,258
Or like when Kramer was
on Murphy Brown.

142
00:08:11,342 --> 00:08:14,678
-Who?
-Hey, you want to get out of here?

143
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:22,520
I don't want MBN to just be another boring
old network, you know what I mean?

144
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,604
-Yes, totally.
-I want to take risks.

145
00:08:24,688 --> 00:08:28,650
I want to swing for the fences, you know?
Otherwise, what are we doing?

146
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:31,653
Oh, my God, is it morning?
We stayed up all night talking,

147
00:08:31,736 --> 00:08:34,865
-and we didn't even have sex.
-Well, it's not too late.

148
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:35,949
Oh!

149
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:43,123
-That was fantastic.
-Oh, yes.

150
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:46,293
Of course, I haven't had sex in 30 years.
I hope.

151
00:08:46,377 --> 00:08:47,836
-Something's wrong.
-What is it?

152
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,298
I don't know, I feel weird, like I want
to spend more time with you

153
00:08:51,382 --> 00:08:54,176
-even though I know we just had sex.
-Oh, okay.

154
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:55,553
No, you don't understand.

155
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:59,139
We already had sex,
but I still want to spend time with you.

156
00:08:59,264 --> 00:09:03,394
Is that normal? Am I normal?
What is happening to me?

157
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:05,187
We can spend more time together.

158
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:10,609
I want to do things with you.
Fully clothed, sober, in daylight hours.

159
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:12,777
-Okay.
-I don't understand these feelings.

160
00:09:12,903 --> 00:09:16,990
Let's get food? Or walk in park? Or--

161
00:09:17,074 --> 00:09:19,743
Oh, God, it's coming. I can't stop it.

162
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:23,747
-Do you want to go to Disneyland?
-Okay.

163
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,469
Disneyland has a lot more sparking wires
and loose nails than I remember.

164
00:09:37,553 --> 00:09:40,347
Please hold your questions
until the end of the tour.

165
00:09:40,472 --> 00:09:44,309
Here we have
Mr. Todd's Wild Death-Coaster.

166
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,686
The name is a work in progress,

167
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,107
but we wanted to work "death"
into the title for liability reasons.

168
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:55,320
And this is Gabe Jr.,
the Grease Fire of the Caribbean.

169
00:09:55,404 --> 00:10:00,367
-This is boring. I want to go home.
-Vincent, be nice!

170
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:03,078
He's a little cranky
because he just got adult braces.

171
00:10:03,161 --> 00:10:07,332
-You mean, braces.
-Princess Carolyn, stop embarrassing me!

172
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,250
Ugh.

173
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:14,047
And here we have Cinderella's
magical pile of used mattresses.

174
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:15,132
Help!

175
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,301
Is it a good idea
to keep all those mattresses

176
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:21,555
-so close to an active grease fire?
-Where's your sense of wonder, Diane?

177
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,434
-Your friend is really negative.
-Yeah, don't be so negative, Diane.

178
00:10:25,517 --> 00:10:27,311
-What?
-You know I hate negativity.

179
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:31,022
I mean, I don't hate it because
that's also negative, but you know.

180
00:10:35,026 --> 00:10:39,406
-Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.
-Hey, buddy. This place is amazing.

181
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,618
It's like some sort of Disney version
of Knott's Berry Farm.

182
00:10:42,701 --> 00:10:45,078
Oh, that's exactly
what I was going for!

183
00:10:45,162 --> 00:10:46,705
I can't wait to get involved

184
00:10:46,788 --> 00:10:49,958
and really spray the old
Mr. Peanutbutter scent on everything.

185
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:55,255
Uh, I was sort of thinking of this
as kind of just my thing.

186
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:59,677
Well, technically, you did build this
while working for P.B. Livin,

187
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,138
so I have the blah-blah-blah
of first refusal or whatever.

188
00:11:03,221 --> 00:11:04,848
Oh, uh, okay.

189
00:11:04,973 --> 00:11:06,766
I mean, that's just good business.

190
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,312
We're in this together now, Todd,
and nothing will distract me from--

191
00:11:10,395 --> 00:11:14,107
Erica! You can't be here.
This place is filled with children.

192
00:11:16,652 --> 00:11:19,237
Coach said he saw you headed
to the visitor's locker room

193
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:20,572
with a steel pipe.

194
00:11:20,656 --> 00:11:23,450
You really think I'm the guy
who busted that pinto's leg?

195
00:11:23,534 --> 00:11:27,245
'Cause if I am, you should be
a lot more goddamn scared of me.

196
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:31,750
Hey! My girlfriend's here.
Look, everyone! I have a girlfriend!

197
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,210
Sure. We'll cut there.

198
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,795
The middle of your line
is as good a place as any.

199
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:38,173
-What are you doing here?
-Just wanted to stop by.

200
00:11:38,256 --> 00:11:41,176
We're filming Hey, I Think
You Can Dance! next door.

201
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:43,387
Look at you, all professional.

202
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,515
Like Natalie Portman in that movie
where she was a professional.

203
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,850
Who?
People are watching.

204
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:49,768
Ugh.

205
00:11:49,851 --> 00:11:52,187
The first time BoJack dates a woman
his own age,

206
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,398
she's basically just
a stunted 20-year-old.

207
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:57,192
Well, BoJack's stunted, too.
He got famous in his twenties,

208
00:11:57,275 --> 00:11:58,902
so he'll be
in his twenties forever.

209
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:01,530
After you get famous, you stop growing,
you don't have to.

210
00:12:01,613 --> 00:12:04,074
Every celebrity has
an age of stagnation.

211
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,701
I'm glad I never got famous.

212
00:12:05,784 --> 00:12:08,870
I mean, I did write a best-selling book,
but I'm not famous-famous.

213
00:12:08,953 --> 00:12:10,914
It doesn't just happen
when you get famous.

214
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:13,208
Your age of stagnation
is when you stop growing.

215
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:16,044
For most, it's when they get married,
settle into a routine.

216
00:12:16,127 --> 00:12:18,338
You meet someone
who loves you unconditionally

217
00:12:18,422 --> 00:12:21,132
and never challenges you
or wants you to change,

218
00:12:21,216 --> 00:12:23,134
and then you never change.

219
00:12:23,218 --> 00:12:26,471
But mostly it's just the famous people,
right?

220
00:12:29,474 --> 00:12:32,894
Stella! Stella!

221
00:12:32,977 --> 00:12:34,396
Corona Light.

222
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:36,523
This place is incredible.

223
00:12:36,607 --> 00:12:38,734
I wanted to make you feel at home,

224
00:12:38,817 --> 00:12:42,153
and nothing was bigger in the '80s
than '50s nostalgia.

225
00:12:42,237 --> 00:12:46,324
It really feels like I'm back in the '80s,
feeling like I'm back in the '50s.

226
00:12:46,408 --> 00:12:49,661
It's like if Back to the Future
and Peggy Sue Got Married got married.

227
00:12:49,745 --> 00:12:51,538
Okay, teenyboppers,

228
00:12:51,622 --> 00:12:54,708
let's take things back
to the '50s, '50s style,

229
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:58,837
with this classic '50s hit
that everybody remembers:

230
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,006
"I Just Met My Perfect Match."

231
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:12,476
Wanda, these last few days
have been so amazing.

232
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:14,561
You've given me a fresh start.

233
00:13:14,645 --> 00:13:17,981
In fact, it almost feels like
I just woke up from a 30-year coma.

234
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:21,025
I'm sorry, did you say you just woke up
from a 30-year coma?

235
00:13:21,109 --> 00:13:23,528
-Oh, no, not me. Her.
-That's insane.

236
00:13:23,612 --> 00:13:25,363
I just woke up from a 30-year coma.

237
00:13:26,615 --> 00:13:28,950
Whoa!
Sorry about that needle skip, folks.

238
00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:32,537
Let's start that song again
from the beginning.

239
00:13:39,503 --> 00:13:40,796
I'm Alex.

240
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:42,673
-Wanda.
-And I'm BoJack.

241
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:45,133
It's been really tough for me
these last few weeks.

242
00:13:45,216 --> 00:13:48,970
I've never seen Home Alone and everyone
makes me feel like a freak because of it.

243
00:13:49,053 --> 00:13:51,598
-You've never seen Home Alone?
-I've never seen it!

244
00:13:51,682 --> 00:13:54,893
-Also, I don't really know what a DVR is.
-Neither do I!

245
00:13:55,018 --> 00:13:59,189
-No one does. It's just a magic box.
-Wanda, we have so much in common.

246
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,691
Really it's just one thing.

247
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:03,902
You can't count each individual thing
as a different thing.

248
00:14:03,985 --> 00:14:06,571
That's like saying I have a lot
in common with Kanye West

249
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:08,031
because we both breathe air.

250
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,575
Who? Jinx. Buy me a Coke Zero.

251
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:12,786
What's a Coke Zero?
I have no idea.

252
00:14:13,995 --> 00:14:17,290
We gotta hang out more. I didn't know
there was anyone else like me.

253
00:14:17,374 --> 00:14:20,460
Give me your fax and pager number
so I can add them to my Rolodex.

254
00:14:20,544 --> 00:14:21,753
Tubular.

255
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:27,300
I don't trust that guy.
I bet he's seen Home Alone.

256
00:14:27,384 --> 00:14:30,261
BoJack, I'm starting to lose
the thread of your character.

257
00:14:30,345 --> 00:14:34,057
You think you can drop the jealous
boyfriend routine? It feels a little done.

258
00:14:34,182 --> 00:14:36,560
You're right, I'm sorry.
Call me Snoop Dogg

259
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:39,771
-because I will drop it like it's hot.
-BoJack, I don't--

260
00:14:39,855 --> 00:14:43,775
I got that one! Snoopy the dog.
From "Peanuts." Okay.

261
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,533
I got here as fast as I could.

262
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:54,160
Where's this next Haley Joel Osment?

263
00:14:54,244 --> 00:14:56,496
-That was a lie to get you here.
-Aw, fish.

264
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,791
-There's never a next Haley Joel Osment.
-And there never will be.

265
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,711
Sorry I tricked you, but with Todd
running his own Disneyland

266
00:15:02,794 --> 00:15:04,713
and actress Margo Martindale
in prison

267
00:15:04,796 --> 00:15:07,883
for some reason I don't remember,
you're the best friend I've got.

268
00:15:07,966 --> 00:15:11,219
Now grab the binoculars. I need dirt
on Wanda's new gentleman friend.

269
00:15:11,302 --> 00:15:13,304
No, BoJack. What's the play here?

270
00:15:13,388 --> 00:15:15,682
You'll find one little imperfection
and harp on it

271
00:15:15,766 --> 00:15:17,141
like you do with my boyfriend?

272
00:15:17,267 --> 00:15:20,061
You do understand what my "thing" is
with your boyfriend?

273
00:15:20,144 --> 00:15:22,606
You'll just push her
into this other guy's arms.

274
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:25,525
Wanda likes you. Why ruin that?

275
00:15:27,402 --> 00:15:30,655
This is Comrade Alexander
calling KGB High Command.

276
00:15:30,739 --> 00:15:32,950
It's been two weeks since I woke up,

277
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,452
and I still have not been contacted
by my handlers.

278
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:38,830
I am awaiting orders to take down
the American dogs and pigs

279
00:15:38,914 --> 00:15:42,166
and other various animals and humans.
Come in, KGB High Command.

280
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:46,296
Slap my salami, the guy's a commie.

281
00:15:51,092 --> 00:15:52,970
Hey, what's going on here?

282
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:56,306
You've been served
with a cease-and-desist from my clients,

283
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:57,933
the Walt Disney Company.

284
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:01,185
I wanted to make sure what we were
doing here was 100 percent legal,

285
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:03,146
-so I called a lawyer.
-Wait, what?

286
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:06,691
As it turns out, it's not legal at all.
Who knew?

287
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:10,361
-Mr. Peanutbutter.
-We'll see you in court.

288
00:16:10,445 --> 00:16:13,949
-The food court?
-No. Regular court.

289
00:16:14,032 --> 00:16:19,078
Okay. But also I'm hungry, so I might
just stop by the food court first.

290
00:16:20,664 --> 00:16:26,003
Let the record show, this is the single
dumbest case I've ever adjudicated.

291
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,129
-Mr. Chavez?
-Okay.

292
00:16:28,212 --> 00:16:29,923
I'm just gonna throw this out there.

293
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:34,385
Is it possible maybe when the other guys
tried to copyright the name Disneyland,

294
00:16:34,469 --> 00:16:36,763
they wrote down something else
by mistake,

295
00:16:36,847 --> 00:16:39,098
so "Disneyland" is still up for grabs?

296
00:16:39,182 --> 00:16:44,813
Okay, well, let's have a look
at the Articles of Incorporation to see

297
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:49,651
if Walt Disney accidentally trademarked
the wrong name. I'm sure these--

298
00:16:50,861 --> 00:16:54,739
-What?
-There's a typo. Di-isneyland.

299
00:16:54,823 --> 00:16:59,243
With two "i"s. That son of a gun
trademarked the wrong name.

300
00:16:59,327 --> 00:17:01,412
May I, counselor?

301
00:17:01,496 --> 00:17:05,000
D-I-I-S.
This is unambiguous.

302
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:08,712
-I find in favor of the defendant.
-Aw, shit.

303
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:11,297
-You're the defendant.
-Aw, sweet!

304
00:17:11,381 --> 00:17:15,093
Your Otter, this is a gross miscarriage
of justice.

305
00:17:15,176 --> 00:17:18,013
Hooray! Gross miscarriage!

306
00:17:21,432 --> 00:17:27,230
And that's how I turned my dream into
what I call "The Happiest Place On Urf."

307
00:17:27,355 --> 00:17:30,734
Urf is a made-up magical kingdom
I added to the Disney canon.

308
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:34,362
-Americans, they like this theme park?
-Oh, they love it.

309
00:17:34,445 --> 00:17:36,573
It represents everything
America stands for.

310
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:37,949
Da.

311
00:17:38,033 --> 00:17:40,535
-I mean, yeah.
-We did it, buddy!

312
00:17:40,618 --> 00:17:42,704
Actually, I did it.

313
00:17:42,787 --> 00:17:49,127
I had the idea to build a park,
I did all the work and I beat the lawsuit.

314
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:54,507
-Well, there's no "i" in "team," right?
-But there is an "i" in "Disneyland."

315
00:17:54,591 --> 00:18:00,430
And unlike that other Disneyland,
this Disneyland only has one "i".

316
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:01,765
What are you saying?

317
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:04,601
You're not welcome
at my theme park anymore.

318
00:18:04,726 --> 00:18:09,647
There's only room for one goofy dog there
and his name is Pluto.

319
00:18:09,731 --> 00:18:11,024
Todd, no.

320
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:14,945
I've told the bees
if they see you to sting you on sight.

321
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:19,699
You understand. It's nothing personal.
It's just good business.

322
00:18:19,783 --> 00:18:22,160
And that's how we do business on Urf.

323
00:18:22,243 --> 00:18:26,497
-I don't like you like this.
-I learned it from you.

324
00:18:26,581 --> 00:18:28,708
If I could get everyone's attention.

325
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:31,878
You're probably wondering
why I invited you all here tonight.

326
00:18:31,962 --> 00:18:34,464
You said it was to celebrate
Todd's legal victory.

327
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,591
Right, but obviously,
I don't care about that,

328
00:18:36,674 --> 00:18:38,718
so you're probably wondering
the real reason.

329
00:18:38,802 --> 00:18:41,345
No, we just took you at face value.

330
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:43,431
We have a special guest here tonight.

331
00:18:43,514 --> 00:18:46,768
Alex. Or should I say "comrade"?

332
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:52,398
-Why would you say "comrade"?
-Oh, I forgot to explain that part.

333
00:18:52,482 --> 00:18:56,069
Alex is a KGB agent
bent on destroying America.

334
00:18:57,236 --> 00:19:00,907
-It truly is a small world after all!
-Alex, is that true?

335
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,701
Okay, yes. It's true.

336
00:19:03,785 --> 00:19:07,122
I was a deep-cover KGB operative
before I went into my coma.

337
00:19:07,205 --> 00:19:09,707
I've been trying to contact
my handler in Russia,

338
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,627
but I can't reach him
and I don't know if I ever will.

339
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,753
Aww!

340
00:19:13,837 --> 00:19:16,297
No! He's-- It's not adorable!

341
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,301
He's a soviet sleeper-agent
who doesn't realize the Cold War is over.

342
00:19:20,384 --> 00:19:23,054
I felt totally alone in this world
before I met Wanda.

343
00:19:23,138 --> 00:19:25,849
And then I met all of you, my friends.

344
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:27,600
But if you're gonna kick me to the curb

345
00:19:27,684 --> 00:19:30,103
just because I think
you're all capitalist swine

346
00:19:30,228 --> 00:19:33,481
and want to see your way
of life destroyed, well, so be it.

347
00:19:33,564 --> 00:19:38,277
-Or should I say, So-vi-et.
-Oh! Cute. Wordplay.

348
00:19:38,361 --> 00:19:41,781
-That's not even good wordplay.
-Wait, how did you know all this?

349
00:19:41,865 --> 00:19:45,869
-BoJack, were you spying on him?
-He is literally a spy

350
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:48,705
trying to destroy America,
the country we all live in.

351
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:49,998
How am I the bad guy here?

352
00:19:50,081 --> 00:19:54,169
BoJack, I am really bumping on
the whole you-not-liking-Alex of it all.

353
00:19:54,252 --> 00:19:56,754
-You told me you were going to drop it.
-Yeah, but--

354
00:19:56,838 --> 00:19:58,422
I don't care about Alex.

355
00:19:58,506 --> 00:20:00,675
I want to know what happened
to the amazing guy

356
00:20:00,758 --> 00:20:04,054
I spent the last few days with,
because if this is who you are,

357
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:05,596
I don't think I like it.

358
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,974
Alex, would you take me back
to my sister's place?

359
00:20:08,058 --> 00:20:10,852
Sure thing, Wanda.
And I can get you there fast

360
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,478
because I'm always Russian.

361
00:20:12,562 --> 00:20:13,646
Aww!

362
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,856
Seriously?

363
00:20:20,278 --> 00:20:23,364
I got here as fast as I could.
Where's the next Dakota Fa--?

364
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:25,075
Oh, I get what happened.

365
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:28,245
Could you get me a beer from the fridge?
I didn't want to stand up.

366
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,538
Wait, no. I don't deserve beer.

367
00:20:30,621 --> 00:20:33,416
You called me all the way over here
to not get you a beer?

368
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:36,836
Why do I always do this?
I push away everyone I care about.

369
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,005
Oh, do you? I never noticed that.

370
00:20:39,089 --> 00:20:41,883
Look, you obviously really care
about this girl

371
00:20:41,966 --> 00:20:44,552
and that scares you,
so you sabotage yourself.

372
00:20:44,635 --> 00:20:47,513
That's my problem.
I'm too good at sabotage.

373
00:20:47,597 --> 00:20:51,475
-Why am I so good at everything I do?
-Hey, I got a crazy idea.

374
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:54,771
How about you just stop sulking
and go win her back, dummy?

375
00:20:54,896 --> 00:20:58,775
You're right. I gotta win her back,
put it all on the line. You know what?

376
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:01,402
I think I will have that beer,
can you get it for me?

377
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:05,198
-Why do I bother?
-Hey, grab a beer for yourself, too!

378
00:21:05,282 --> 00:21:06,908
Actually, I want both beers!

379
00:21:13,998 --> 00:21:16,126
-Wanda.
-What do you want, BoJack?

380
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:18,169
There's something I gotta say.
When I was--

381
00:21:18,253 --> 00:21:21,881
-Todd! There's something I gotta say!
-Hey, I'm kind of already doing--

382
00:21:21,965 --> 00:21:24,634
I never should have tried
to make your thing my thing!

383
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:28,721
I just got excited and wanted to smear
Mr. Peanutbutter all over everything.

384
00:21:28,805 --> 00:21:32,267
I should have been supporting you,
like this support beam.

385
00:21:34,311 --> 00:21:38,064
-Or a different support beam.
-It's my fault.

386
00:21:38,148 --> 00:21:41,776
The point of Disneyland isn't
to make money and win lawsuits.

387
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:43,069
But I forgot that.

388
00:21:43,194 --> 00:21:47,198
So, these two were so consumed
by greed that it destroyed them.

389
00:21:47,282 --> 00:21:49,700
You know, I came here today
to blow up Disneyland.

390
00:21:49,784 --> 00:21:51,452
-You what?
-But now I realize,

391
00:21:51,535 --> 00:21:53,454
I don't need to take down capitalism.

392
00:21:53,537 --> 00:21:56,374
Capitalism sows the seeds
for its own destruction.

393
00:21:56,457 --> 00:21:59,627
It's a snake that eats itself.
It's only a matter of time.

394
00:22:01,296 --> 00:22:03,340
Hey, buddy, let's just say we-- Oh!

395
00:22:04,048 --> 00:22:07,218
Oh, no, no, no. No!

396
00:22:07,302 --> 00:22:08,928
Gabe Jr.!

397
00:22:09,012 --> 00:22:10,888
Quick, Todd! The mattress pile!

398
00:22:10,972 --> 00:22:14,058
Jump to safety! No!

399
00:22:14,142 --> 00:22:17,020
Bees, help!
Your queen commands you!

400
00:22:20,982 --> 00:22:25,362
No! Bees! Come on!

401
00:22:26,863 --> 00:22:30,033
-You gotta-- Over the--
-What is it, boy? What's wrong?

402
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:34,078
-Hey, there's trouble.
-Did some kid fall down a well?

403
00:22:34,162 --> 00:22:35,496
No, no, no! Listen.

404
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:37,748
He's trying to tell us
a kid fell down a well.

405
00:22:37,832 --> 00:22:40,877
-Let's go, go, go! Come on!
-Bad, bad, bad. You gotta--

406
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,380
No, no, no, listen!

407
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,465
Wait, Wanda, we need to talk.

408
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:48,676
-But the fire.
-I don't care about that.

409
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:51,804
Look, the great guy you've been
getting to know, that's me.

410
00:22:51,888 --> 00:22:53,723
That other guy,
the guy from the party,

411
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:57,852
that's me too and you need
to know that. I'm not perfect.

412
00:22:57,935 --> 00:23:01,605
I'm cynical and I'm possessive
and I can sometimes fly off the handle.

413
00:23:01,731 --> 00:23:05,026
I'm not always the best
at being not terrible.

414
00:23:05,109 --> 00:23:07,404
I gotta say,
I'm not loving this pitch so far.

415
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:10,073
But I want to be better,
I'm trying to be better.

416
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:12,742
And when I'm around you,
for the first time in 30 years,

417
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,327
I feel like I can be.

418
00:23:14,411 --> 00:23:16,704
Wanda, you make me want
to be a better man.

419
00:23:16,787 --> 00:23:18,873
Wow. That's a great line.

420
00:23:18,956 --> 00:23:21,625
-Did you just come up with that?
-Yes.

421
00:23:21,709 --> 00:23:25,213
Hey, boys and girls,
this is your park DJ speaking.

422
00:23:25,296 --> 00:23:28,216
And as the Titanic's band played on
as the ship sank,

423
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:33,430
so too will I spin one last record
as my DJ booth is engulfed in flames.

424
00:23:56,786 --> 00:23:58,371
Hooray!

425
00:24:04,127 --> 00:24:05,628
Mr. Peanutbutter.

426
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:07,338
-You saved me!
-No.

427
00:24:07,422 --> 00:24:10,341
I saved us.

428
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,344
Woo-hoo!

429
00:24:13,428 --> 00:24:16,306
-I want to give this a real shot.
-I don't know, BoJack.

430
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:19,267
I just got out of my coma,
and I don't have time to waste

431
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,352
if you're still figuring your shit out.

432
00:24:21,436 --> 00:24:24,314
Plus, it's hard to think straight
with this fire everywhere.

433
00:24:24,439 --> 00:24:26,232
-Move in with me.
-What?

434
00:24:26,316 --> 00:24:28,526
I know it feels fast.
We barely know each other.

435
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:31,195
It's crazy, but I like you.

436
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,407
And sometimes you gotta swing
for the fences, right?

437
00:24:34,491 --> 00:24:36,451
-Okay.
-Yeah?

438
00:24:36,534 --> 00:24:39,537
Yeah. Let's move in together.
Let's do it.

439
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,332
It's crazy, but let's do it!

440
00:25:30,087 --> 00:25:33,966
Boxer versus raptor.
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na!
