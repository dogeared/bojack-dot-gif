1
00:00:07,817 --> 00:00:11,404
I'm sorry
I broke your expensive bachelor vase.

2
00:00:11,488 --> 00:00:12,405
Aww.

3
00:00:12,489 --> 00:00:15,534
That's all right. I've learned
that when you're in a loving family

4
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,661
there's nothing wrong
with a little horsin' around.

5
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:20,913
Cut!

6
00:00:20,997 --> 00:00:22,374
That's the show, folks.

7
00:00:22,457 --> 00:00:24,876
Now, let's hear it for our amazing cast.

8
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:26,127
Joelle.

9
00:00:26,211 --> 00:00:27,086
Bradley.

10
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,754
Little Sarah Lynn.

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,510
And our star, BoJack Horseman!

12
00:00:33,593 --> 00:00:36,054
Thanks for coming out.
Thank you very much.

13
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:37,638
--Wow!

14
00:00:37,722 --> 00:00:38,557
Great pilot.

15
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:42,185
We got the biggest laugh I ever heard
with that "gag me with a spoon" joke.

16
00:00:42,268 --> 00:00:45,230
And then we topped it
with the "get a room" joke.

17
00:00:45,313 --> 00:00:46,814
This was so fun.

18
00:00:46,898 --> 00:00:48,358
Do we get to make more?

19
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:49,901
I think we got a real shot.

20
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:53,696
And as long as the ratings don't dip
below a dismal 15 million a night,

21
00:00:53,779 --> 00:00:55,574
we could be on the air for many years.

22
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:56,533
-No way!
-All right!

23
00:00:56,616 --> 00:00:57,992
-Your Squirt, sir.
-Thank you.

24
00:00:58,076 --> 00:01:00,579
And if that happens,
take care of each other.

25
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:04,082
No matter what,
we're going to stick together.

26
00:02:16,237 --> 00:02:19,365
Thank you, Tina,
for those touching grunts and growls.

27
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:20,450
I'm Henry Winkler.

28
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:23,995
You probably remember me
from my 2002 guest role

29
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:26,372
Special Victims Unit.

30
00:02:26,456 --> 00:02:27,332
-Whoo!
-Thank you.

31
00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:30,918
But perhaps the greatest role
I've ever played is friend.

32
00:02:31,002 --> 00:02:32,671
Herb was a dear friend

33
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:37,133
and I am honored to be dedicating
this bench in his memory.

34
00:02:38,718 --> 00:02:42,221
In his last days, Herb's cancer
had gone into remission.

35
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:43,389
He was full of hope.

36
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:46,851
But on the drive home from the hospital,
his brakes gave out,

37
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:49,270
he crashed into a truck full of peanuts.

38
00:02:49,354 --> 00:02:52,607
He survived the crash,
but he was allergic to peanuts.

39
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:53,858
He died instantly.

40
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:56,861
Let us now read his final tweets.

41
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:59,155
"I'm gonna live forever!

42
00:02:59,238 --> 00:03:00,615
Hashtag 'cancer free.'

43
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:02,450
Hashtag 'invincible.'

44
00:03:02,534 --> 00:03:05,161
Hashtag 'tweeting while driving.'

45
00:03:05,244 --> 00:03:07,622
Oh, no, I think I'm gonna hit that truck.

46
00:03:07,706 --> 00:03:10,875
Hashtag 'hopefully it isn't full
of peanuts.'

47
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:14,003
Hashtag 'Oh, no. It was full of peanuts.'"

48
00:03:15,046 --> 00:03:17,131
I was wondering
where you wandered off to.

49
00:03:17,256 --> 00:03:18,966
-Oh, shit. Hey.
-Hey.

50
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,926
I'm no good with funerals.

51
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,681
When I cry, it messes up my makeup
and then I get really bummed out.

52
00:03:24,764 --> 00:03:25,640
Yeah, same for me.

53
00:03:25,724 --> 00:03:27,892
Herb told me you came
by the house last summer.

54
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:29,185
Yeah?

55
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:31,979
Did he tell you anything else?

56
00:03:32,063 --> 00:03:35,066
No, we talked about cancer,
how hard it is living with cancer,

57
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:37,276
about the L.A. Kings,
and then back to cancer.

58
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,779
-Probably--
-Then I read that chapter in your book

59
00:03:39,862 --> 00:03:42,657
about how he never forgave you
and he tried to kick you out of the house

60
00:03:42,741 --> 00:03:45,368
and you ended up wrestling on the floor
over a telescope.

61
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:48,037
-Oh, you did read that part?
-Yeah.

62
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,249
I just wish
there was something I could do.

63
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,125
Okay, I gotta go.

64
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:55,127
Wait, I haven't seen you in 30 years.

65
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:58,381
You wanna go grab a cup of vodka?
I-- I'm sorry, the funeral.

66
00:03:58,464 --> 00:03:59,882
I mean, a bottle of vodka?

67
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:01,634
No. You should stick around.

68
00:04:01,718 --> 00:04:04,345
Hey, maybe you'll find
that something you're looking for.

69
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:07,348
But if you're ever in New Mexico,
drop me a line.

70
00:04:07,432 --> 00:04:08,349
New Mexico?

71
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:09,768
I thought you lived in Maine.

72
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,143
I always pictured you there.

73
00:04:11,227 --> 00:04:12,395
A little house by a lake?

74
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:15,398
I was just there for, like, a month,
30 years ago.

75
00:04:15,481 --> 00:04:18,067
-I live outside Santa Fe now.
-Oh.

76
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:29,370
- Think everyone here read my book?
- I didn't.

77
00:04:29,454 --> 00:04:30,538
Of course you didn't.

78
00:04:30,663 --> 00:04:32,832
Shut up, Todd!

79
00:04:32,915 --> 00:04:35,376
Okay, you're clearly in one of your moods.

80
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,297
I'm gonna go play astronaut in the trunk
of your car for the next few hours.

81
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,881
Have fun being sad.

82
00:04:41,006 --> 00:04:43,676
Do you know what you're supposed to do
with our date pits?

83
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,262
Why serve dates
and not have a place to put the pits?

84
00:04:46,345 --> 00:04:48,347
You know,
some people just have no class.

85
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:50,099
What are you doing here?
You didn't know Herb.

86
00:04:50,182 --> 00:04:53,936
No, but I do know a hot ticket,
and this funeral's a real whom's-whom.

87
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:56,481
Henry Winkler,
Jake and Maggot Gyllenhaal,

88
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:59,358
that Pakistani girl
who keeps winning Nobel Prizes.

89
00:04:59,442 --> 00:05:00,943
I'm gonna go rub me some elbows.

90
00:05:01,026 --> 00:05:03,279
There's so much to hate
about what you just said.

91
00:05:03,362 --> 00:05:06,699
Good news. You know when someone dies,
everyone wants to buy their shit?

92
00:05:06,783 --> 00:05:08,576
You're lucky you have a piece
of Horsin' Around,

93
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,745
because this is where money
starts rolling in.

94
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:12,664
I don't want that. That's blood money.

95
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:15,207
Well, what do you want me to do with it?
It's coming.

96
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,084
I don't know. Give it to some orphans.

97
00:05:17,168 --> 00:05:19,128
-I can't deal with this.
-Oh, come on!

98
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:22,381
You don't think Elton John
was raking it in when Diana died?

99
00:05:22,465 --> 00:05:26,427
More like "Candle in the Windfall."
Cha-ching! Hmm...

100
00:05:27,804 --> 00:05:32,183
You have to live with the shitty
thing you did for the rest of your life.

101
00:05:33,225 --> 00:05:34,059
Huh.

102
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,521
Hello, love.

103
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:38,857
Hey, Joelle,
I actually came here to be alone.

104
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,150
I'm at my wit's end, I truly am.

105
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:44,403
I just flew in across the pond
and I don't know which end is up.

106
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:48,533
This might be a stupid question,
but were you always so... British?

107
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:51,786
Oh, let's get some light in here,
it's so dreadfully dreary.

108
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,622
Because I'm, like, 70 percent sure
you used to be American.

109
00:05:54,706 --> 00:05:55,581
That's better.

110
00:05:55,665 --> 00:05:58,459
Hey, this one's having a freak-out.
She needs to lie down.

111
00:05:58,543 --> 00:05:59,752
I'm not freaking out.

112
00:05:59,836 --> 00:06:02,588
I just don't understand
why that lady was being all judgy.

113
00:06:02,672 --> 00:06:06,300
You were touching her face
and telling her she was gonna die next.

114
00:06:06,425 --> 00:06:08,594
I'm eccentric. I do weird shit.

115
00:06:08,678 --> 00:06:10,638
How is that my problem?

116
00:06:10,722 --> 00:06:14,433
Hey, when was the last time
all four of us were in the same room?

117
00:06:14,517 --> 00:06:16,602
Probably not since the show ended.

118
00:06:16,686 --> 00:06:19,230
Yeah, I left California
pretty much right after.

119
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,733
Now I got the biggest hardware store
in Seattle.

120
00:06:21,816 --> 00:06:24,068
That's a lie. We're actually in Olympia.

121
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:27,988
And I'm on the West End
playing Juliet's... nurse.

122
00:06:28,072 --> 00:06:30,241
-And how are your kids?
-I don't have any kids.

123
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:32,410
Oh, I just assumed
you had a bunch of kids,

124
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:34,537
'cause, you know, your body.

125
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,496
Come on, Sarah Lynn.

126
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,623
I assumed
you weren't still a massive cunt.

127
00:06:37,707 --> 00:06:40,752
-Jesus Christ, Joelle.
-That's an okay thing to say in England.

128
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:42,962
Shove it up your ass
with a spoonful of sugar,

129
00:06:43,045 --> 00:06:45,798
you supercalifragilisticexpiali-bitch!

130
00:06:45,882 --> 00:06:47,800
-Guys, hey, hey, come on.
-Let go of me!

131
00:06:47,926 --> 00:06:50,845
-I'm gonna hulk out!
-Guys, can we just be civil for one day?

132
00:06:50,929 --> 00:06:53,097
-Oh, you're one to talk.
-What's that mean?

133
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,641
Were you being civil
when you had sex with my mom?

134
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:59,437
What? I never-- Why would--? Wait, which
one was your mom? Blond hair? Glasses?

135
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,314
-No.
-This sucks. You guys suck.

136
00:07:02,398 --> 00:07:04,358
I don't even know
why I came to this party.

137
00:07:04,442 --> 00:07:06,569
It's not a party, it's Herb's funeral.

138
00:07:06,652 --> 00:07:07,779
Herb died?

139
00:07:07,862 --> 00:07:11,073
You know, maybe it's for the best
we don't get together that often.

140
00:07:11,156 --> 00:07:13,200
We'd most likely drive each other mad.

141
00:07:13,284 --> 00:07:15,954
Well, no one knows how to get
under your skin like family.

142
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,371
We're not a family, BoJack.

143
00:07:17,455 --> 00:07:20,833
We probably won't even see each other
again, until the next funeral.

144
00:07:22,585 --> 00:07:24,963
-Why are you all looking at me?
-You are the oldest.

145
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,589
You are a severe alcoholic.

146
00:07:26,672 --> 00:07:30,009
I'm honestly so high right now,
I don't even know where I'm looking.

147
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:33,137
Anyway, so long, thanks for the memories,

148
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,932
and don't forget to suck a dick, dumbshi--

149
00:07:36,015 --> 00:07:39,101
Pardon me. Is one of you Sarah Lynn?

150
00:07:39,184 --> 00:07:41,771
I am. Of course. God, are you blind?

151
00:07:41,854 --> 00:07:42,939
Yes.

152
00:07:43,022 --> 00:07:44,231
Well, forgive me.

153
00:07:44,315 --> 00:07:46,943
I'm Herb Kazzaz's blind executor.

154
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:53,449
Per the instructions of his last will
and testament, I am to give you this disk.

155
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:54,867
Am I close?

156
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:56,661
Just take the disk from the guy.

157
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:59,998
It contains directions to Herb's gold.

158
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:01,248
Herb's gold?

159
00:08:01,332 --> 00:08:03,208
There were no further details.

160
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:05,044
He was a peculiar client.

161
00:08:05,127 --> 00:08:07,588
I told him, I'm not actually an attorney,

162
00:08:07,672 --> 00:08:09,131
I'm just a blind man.

163
00:08:09,214 --> 00:08:12,301
Still, Herb thought me wise
for some reason.

164
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:15,888
Perhaps it is my overly formal
manner of speech.

165
00:08:15,972 --> 00:08:19,017
I bid you good day.

166
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,810
Oh, pardon me. Ow!

167
00:08:20,893 --> 00:08:22,269
Right at shin level.

168
00:08:22,353 --> 00:08:25,064
What are we supposed to do
with a floppy disk?

169
00:08:25,147 --> 00:08:26,065
Hmm...

170
00:08:26,148 --> 00:08:27,191
So, what's up, kiddo?

171
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:29,944
BoJack and my mom
are becoming, like, friends

172
00:08:30,028 --> 00:08:31,487
and they're acting real weird.

173
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,697
Oof! Uh...

174
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,325
Hey, guys, guys, come on!

175
00:08:36,408 --> 00:08:37,994
There's somebody beneath you!

176
00:08:38,077 --> 00:08:39,495
Jeez, all day with the...

177
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:41,246
Listen, kiddo, forget about them.

178
00:08:41,372 --> 00:08:44,458
You wanna check out
this cool new game I got?

179
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:46,544
You have solitaire? On your computer?

180
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:49,254
Yep. It only took 12 disks to install it.

181
00:08:49,338 --> 00:08:50,297
Wow!

182
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,842
Herb's computer had a floppy disk drive.

183
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:56,512
I bet it's still in his old office.
Unless somebody else moved in.

184
00:08:56,595 --> 00:08:58,389
Nobody wanted Herb's office, remember?

185
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:02,309
Because it was under tap dancing star
Savion Glover's office. Let's go.

186
00:09:02,393 --> 00:09:04,603
-What? Right now?
-Yeah. Don't you get it?

187
00:09:04,687 --> 00:09:06,438
Herb's giving us a reunion special.

188
00:09:06,522 --> 00:09:10,068
Remember how he always wanted to do
a treasure hunt episode of Horsin' Around

189
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,195
but the network said it was too edgy?
This is that episode.

190
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:15,740
-I just don't know.
-Yeah, I don't want to do that.

191
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:18,743
Wait, so you'd rather just stay
at this funeral and be sad,

192
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:22,580
instead of going on a crazy adventure
to find our dead friend's secret treasure?

193
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,582
Do you have any idea
how insane you sound?

194
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:27,585
Oh, I get it.
You just don't wanna be here.

195
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:28,794
No, that's not it.

196
00:09:28,878 --> 00:09:31,756
Herb clearly wanted us to do this,
as a family.

197
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,091
Who cares what he wanted?

198
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,926
He doesn't, because he's dead.

199
00:09:35,051 --> 00:09:37,011
And we all know he hated your guts.

200
00:09:37,095 --> 00:09:39,471
Yeah. He was my best friend
and he died hating me

201
00:09:39,555 --> 00:09:41,348
and nothing I do is gonna change that,

202
00:09:41,432 --> 00:09:44,476
but Herb left you that disk
because he wanted us to find his gold.

203
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,564
If we can honor Herb's last wish,
then that's something.

204
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:50,566
I don't know what, but it's something.

205
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,820
-Okay. For Herb.
-Fine.

206
00:09:54,904 --> 00:09:57,698
-Shotgun!
-Everyone knows you can't call shotgun

207
00:09:57,782 --> 00:10:00,325
-before you see the car!
-My turn! Get out of my way!

208
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:01,869
Brad, hang on one second.

209
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:04,789
Your mom wasn't redheaded twins, right?

210
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:06,290
-No.
-Okay.

211
00:10:06,624 --> 00:10:08,584
Hi, Henry Winkler.

212
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:12,046
I loved you in that one episode
SVU.

213
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,714
Oh, thank you.

214
00:10:13,798 --> 00:10:16,300
How would you like
to narrate a documentary for--

215
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,302
Hey, listen, I am so flattered,

216
00:10:18,427 --> 00:10:21,847
but today is about Herb,
so let's respect that.

217
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:24,142
Oh, God, I-- I'm so sorry.

218
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,852
I'll let you get back to your business.

219
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,066
Hey, Winkly, such a shame, isn't it?
About our friend Herb?

220
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,859
It really burns my brisket

221
00:10:33,943 --> 00:10:37,071
that some people would turn a funeral
into some kind of schmoozefest.

222
00:10:37,155 --> 00:10:38,906
Yeah. I know.

223
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,450
Those other people are the worst.

224
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:43,702
I bet that woman barely knew Herb.

225
00:10:43,786 --> 00:10:45,412
Anyway, hi, I'm Henry.

226
00:10:45,496 --> 00:10:48,166
I used to volunteer with Herb
at Habitat For Humanity.

227
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:52,086
Or as we like to call it,
Herbitat For Henranity.

228
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,297
We spent most of the day working
on that name,

229
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,509
and only part of the day building,
but still, we helped some people.

230
00:10:58,634 --> 00:11:02,721
-How did you know Herb?
-We also volunteered at a, um...

231
00:11:03,222 --> 00:11:08,060
soup plantation-- Kitchen! Soup kitchen!
Whichever one is the good one.

232
00:11:08,144 --> 00:11:10,521
What? I never knew you did that.

233
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:12,523
Princess Carolyn, please elaborate.

234
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:16,443
Oh, hey, Mr. Peanutbutter, why don't you
talk about how you knew Herb?

235
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:19,113
Oh, I never met the guy.
I'm just here to schmooze.

236
00:11:19,197 --> 00:11:22,700
Tell us about your thing, though,
it sounds fascinating.

237
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:26,370
Everyone, gather round and listen
to Princess Carolyn's story.

238
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:27,705
Okay.

239
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,878
Wow, Herb kept all this old stuff.

240
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:35,504
He sure did.

241
00:11:35,587 --> 00:11:39,175
Look, one of those answering machines
with tapes.

242
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:42,469
Mr. Kazzaz, this is Manny from Pep Boys.

243
00:11:42,594 --> 00:11:45,305
We fixed the brakes on your car,
pick it up tomorrow.

244
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:48,100
Just to reiterate,
your brakes are in great shape

245
00:11:48,184 --> 00:11:50,352
and shouldn't give you any more trouble.

246
00:11:50,435 --> 00:11:53,397
Unless, of course,
someone intentionally cut them,

247
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,441
but why would anyone do that?
I'm sorry, I'm rambling.

248
00:11:56,525 --> 00:11:58,736
Probably because I'm such a big fan.

249
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:01,780
Horsin' Around was a goddamn riot!

250
00:12:01,864 --> 00:12:04,075
I especially loved those kids.

251
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:06,493
You know, wasn't so crazy
about the horse, though--

252
00:12:06,577 --> 00:12:08,787
Message deleted.

253
00:12:08,913 --> 00:12:10,455
Mm... How curious.

254
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:12,833
How could you like Horsin' Around
but not the horse?

255
00:12:12,917 --> 00:12:15,086
That's like watching Castle
but hating castles.

256
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:17,796
I mean, I've never seen it.
I assume it's about castles.

257
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,839
- Wow!

258
00:12:18,923 --> 00:12:22,593
Look at all these old 20th century relics.

259
00:12:23,928 --> 00:12:25,930
-How did you get here?
-I was in your trunk.

260
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:29,683
Now I'm in outer space.

261
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:31,685
Cut it out with your childish high jinks.

262
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:33,395
Yeah, get out of here, dweeb.

263
00:12:33,478 --> 00:12:34,605
Whoa, can't I help?

264
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:37,900
Here's 10 bucks. There's a Squirt machine
by the garage. Get five cans.

265
00:12:37,983 --> 00:12:40,569
You got it. I won't let you down.

266
00:12:40,652 --> 00:12:42,654
--Oh, no!

267
00:12:42,738 --> 00:12:44,198
Your mom, was her name Karen?

268
00:12:44,282 --> 00:12:45,991
-Can we drop it?
-Something with a "K"?

269
00:12:46,075 --> 00:12:49,411
Her name is Nora. You know,
my parents got a divorce because of you.

270
00:12:49,494 --> 00:12:53,874
Nora? I don't know.
I banged so many chicks in the '80s.

271
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:57,795
Okay, Todd, you can do this.

272
00:12:57,878 --> 00:12:58,963
Five Squirts.

273
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:03,092
You just need to take this money
and put it in that machine.

274
00:13:03,175 --> 00:13:05,928
This-- Wait, what?
What happened to the $10?

275
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:10,849
No! Wind! Be cool!

276
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:12,851
- Hey! That's mine!

277
00:13:12,935 --> 00:13:15,479
--Oh...

278
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:20,359
Why does this always happen to me?

279
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,905
Looks like Herb set up a password.

280
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:27,532
Oh, this is easy. Try "BoJack."

281
00:13:27,616 --> 00:13:30,369
-No. Didn't work.
-"BoJack-BFF"?

282
00:13:30,452 --> 00:13:32,663
"BoJack-I-Forgive-You"?

283
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:33,872
Well, I'm out of ideas.

284
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:35,540
Hmm...

285
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:39,170
I'm just, like, so mad.

286
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:40,171
Well, you should be.

287
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:42,589
You're on the show
that fired Herb Kazzaz.

288
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:45,467
What are the writers doing to my baby?
Are they killing it?

289
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,846
Are they putting my baby into a car,
then driving the car into a lake?

290
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:50,931
Topical! I still got it!

291
00:13:51,015 --> 00:13:53,558
They keep giving the best story lines
to Sarah Lynn.

292
00:13:53,642 --> 00:13:56,228
I haven't gotten
a single very special episode.

293
00:13:56,312 --> 00:13:58,897
When am I gonna learn
about drunk driving?

294
00:13:58,981 --> 00:14:01,900
Don't worry so much.
It's my legacy they're crapping all over.

295
00:14:01,984 --> 00:14:03,944
You're gonna come out
smelling like a daisy.

296
00:14:04,028 --> 00:14:06,030
You're too good for this TV stuff, anyway.

297
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:08,407
You're a real actress,
you should be doing theater.

298
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,408
Hold on.

299
00:14:09,491 --> 00:14:11,994
Hey, Joelle.
Wanna go to the mall this weekend?

300
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:14,413
Don't you have any friends
your own age from school?

301
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:18,083
No. My mom's boyfriend home-schools me.
He's a photographer.

302
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:21,461
I'm going to the Lilith Fair this weekend
to support female solidarity.

303
00:14:21,545 --> 00:14:23,714
-So scram!
-Oh...

304
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:26,884
Hey, be nicer to Sarah Lynn, will you?
She didn't choose this life.

305
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:29,053
family.

306
00:14:29,178 --> 00:14:32,264
Okay? You two are family,
whether you like it or not,

307
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:35,976
and that's the most important thing.
You listening? What's the most important?

308
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,770
Family. It's family. I get it.

309
00:14:39,104 --> 00:14:41,440
I've got it! The password is...

310
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,443
"password."

311
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:45,694
It worked!

312
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:47,071
Good thinking, Joelle.

313
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:49,365
So in that memory,
were you British or American?

314
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:51,575
The disk just has just one file on it,
it's--

315
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:54,286
It's the address of a storage locker
in Van Nuys.

316
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,538
A storage locker? Ugh!

317
00:14:56,621 --> 00:14:58,457
This treasure hunt sucks.

318
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,962
At long last, can you keep down the noise,
keep down the funk?

319
00:15:04,046 --> 00:15:08,300
If tap dancing was gonna be a cool thing,
it would have caught on by now!

320
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:15,724
And when the mayor gave us the key
to the city,

321
00:15:15,807 --> 00:15:21,688
Herb said, "Volunteering isn't about keys.
It's about people."

322
00:15:21,772 --> 00:15:23,274
-How touching.
-Good story.

323
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:25,901
-Who are you again?
-Wow, that was touching.

324
00:15:25,984 --> 00:15:27,569
A story that could never be topped.

325
00:15:27,652 --> 00:15:28,946
Or could it?

326
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:32,866
Princess Carolyn, sing us another song
in the key of Kazzaz.

327
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,826
You clearly knew the man so well.

328
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,914
Please tell us another story
but with even more details.

329
00:15:38,997 --> 00:15:41,959
Yes. That's a great idea, Mr. Dog-Man.

330
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:44,544
Tell us another story, Pink Cat Lady.

331
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:46,297
Story, story!

332
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,382
Come on, everybody.
What is this, a funeral?

333
00:15:48,466 --> 00:15:51,635
Story, story, story!

334
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:53,971
Well, you blew it again.

335
00:15:54,096 --> 00:15:55,722
You really are a dweeb.

336
00:15:55,806 --> 00:15:57,015
Don't say that.

337
00:15:57,099 --> 00:15:59,518
Whoa, who are you?

338
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:01,853
Some kind of magical trash troll?

339
00:16:01,937 --> 00:16:03,397
No. I'm a janitor.

340
00:16:03,481 --> 00:16:06,066
But I was clearing out some
of the old stages,

341
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:09,445
and I found this transformation chamber.

342
00:16:09,528 --> 00:16:11,155
Looks like a bunch of old junk.

343
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:12,864
Let me tell you a story.

344
00:16:12,948 --> 00:16:17,661
Back in the '90s, the biggest dweeb
of them all was Steve Urkel.

345
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:19,037
Oh, yeah.

346
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:22,458
It was so funny how he never knew
whether or not he did that.

347
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:26,462
Right.
Well, nerdy Steve Urkel invented a machine

348
00:16:26,545 --> 00:16:30,424
that transformed him
into the debonair Stefan Urquelle.

349
00:16:30,508 --> 00:16:34,594
Mr. Janitor, you're standing next
to a machine right now.

350
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:37,055
Yes. That's why I brought it up.

351
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:38,807
Now, this is just a prop.

352
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,560
But it represents a very powerful idea.

353
00:16:41,643 --> 00:16:46,690
So if I go through that magic machine,
I'll become cool and confident?

354
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:49,651
No, it's a-- It's a prop. I just said--

355
00:16:54,739 --> 00:16:57,701
-I feel different.
-Now, son--

356
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:00,037
Todd? Who's Todd?

357
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,081
My name's Toad. Toad Chavay.

358
00:17:03,165 --> 00:17:05,083
And I gotta get my bubble on.

359
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:08,253
Machine? Squirt me. Hi-yah!

360
00:17:10,755 --> 00:17:12,174
That'll do, machine.

361
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:19,056
Hmm...

362
00:17:20,057 --> 00:17:22,684
Look at all this
Horsin' Around fan correspondence

363
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:24,644
Herb received in the post. Capital!

364
00:17:25,396 --> 00:17:26,313
Guys.

365
00:17:29,525 --> 00:17:31,985
Someone already got to Herb's gold.

366
00:17:32,069 --> 00:17:33,070
Oh, shit.

367
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:35,780
There's a bunch of fur in here.

368
00:17:35,864 --> 00:17:36,990
It's bear fur.

369
00:17:37,908 --> 00:17:40,160
I can tell. My stepdad was a bear.

370
00:17:40,244 --> 00:17:43,663
Herb's nurse is a bear.
You think she knew about this gold?

371
00:17:43,747 --> 00:17:46,542
Hey, listen to this letter.
I think it might be a clue.

372
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:50,003
Ahem. "Dear Herb,
just finished reading your novel.

373
00:17:50,087 --> 00:17:51,171
It's phenomenal.

374
00:17:51,255 --> 00:17:54,049
I'm jealous. I wish I wrote it.

375
00:17:54,132 --> 00:17:57,052
Sincerely, Henry Winkler,

376
00:17:57,135 --> 00:17:59,804
the guy from that one episode
SVU."

377
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,306
Herb wrote a novel?

378
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,058
Oh...

379
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:05,977
You look thin. Did you get into CrossFit?

380
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:07,563
No, Sarah Lynn, I'm dying.

381
00:18:07,646 --> 00:18:11,149
Whatever it is, it is super slimming.
I am for totes jel over here.

382
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:12,484
It's rectal cancer.

383
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:14,528
Ew! Some of us are eating.

384
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:17,573
Look, the reason I called you
is because I need a favor.

385
00:18:17,656 --> 00:18:19,491
Want me to leak a nude pic for charity?

386
00:18:19,575 --> 00:18:21,826
I want you to sober up.

387
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:25,247
First of all, rude. Second, gross.
And third, why?

388
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:29,167
I have a very important job for you,
but if you're zonked out all the time,

389
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:31,920
I'm not sure I can trust you
with the responsibility.

390
00:18:32,003 --> 00:18:35,507
No! I can do it! I'll get clean tomorrow.

391
00:18:36,592 --> 00:18:38,218
I said tomorrow, right?

392
00:18:38,302 --> 00:18:41,597
I've been working on this novel.
I wanna be remembered for something.

393
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:44,849
All I ever did was that stupid sitcom
that got ripped away from me.

394
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:47,978
But now, with this book,
I have something good.

395
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:50,522
I'm telling you, this book is gold.

396
00:18:50,606 --> 00:18:53,525
-It's my Kazzaz-terpiece.
-Whoa.

397
00:18:53,609 --> 00:18:57,571
I want you to make sure
it gets published after I die.

398
00:18:57,655 --> 00:18:59,323
You can count on me.

399
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:01,741
To life, huh? It'll kill you.

400
00:19:02,451 --> 00:19:05,162
Oh, my God, the gold is his manuscript.

401
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:08,165
Herb made me promise
to get it published after he died.

402
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:10,208
And you're just remembering this now?

403
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:13,837
Yeah, I'm remembering a lot of stuff.
The ketamine's wearing off.

404
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,257
Oh, my God, you were the other kid
on Horsin' Around.

405
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:20,135
That's why you've been following us
around all day.

406
00:19:20,218 --> 00:19:24,264
So no one's read this book
except for Henry Winkler

407
00:19:24,389 --> 00:19:27,851
-and now the book is missing?
-He must have been waiting for Herb to die

408
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:30,437
so he could steal the book
and publish it himself.

409
00:19:30,521 --> 00:19:32,606
But then when the cancer went
into remission--

410
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,565
Oh, my God.

411
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:36,026
Guys, I don't think
that car crash was an accident.

412
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,987
I think Herb might have been murdered!

413
00:19:41,573 --> 00:19:42,491
What's going on?

414
00:19:42,574 --> 00:19:44,451
Something about a merger?

415
00:19:48,163 --> 00:19:51,291
My name's Toad, baby.

416
00:19:57,756 --> 00:20:00,050
Yeah.

417
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:02,927
Coolsville, daddy-o.

418
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:06,223
Oh, lookie here.

419
00:20:06,598 --> 00:20:07,974
Yeah.

420
00:20:08,058 --> 00:20:10,143
Yo! That's my bike!

421
00:20:10,852 --> 00:20:13,564
Oops. Did I do that?

422
00:20:15,607 --> 00:20:21,572
Damn. I know I should be mad,
but that guy's just so cool.

423
00:20:22,197 --> 00:20:23,990
And when the river finally stopped,

424
00:20:24,074 --> 00:20:26,826
Herb went over
to a poor little Ottawan boy

425
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,953
and he said, "Son, you have water now."

426
00:20:29,037 --> 00:20:32,457
You know, a lot of people go their
whole lives and they never give a damn.

427
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:36,461
But Herb? He gave those beavers a dam.

428
00:20:36,545 --> 00:20:37,921
That was beautiful.

429
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:40,840
You clearly had a special relationship.

430
00:20:40,924 --> 00:20:42,926
We were gonna sprinkle Herb
over the ocean,

431
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:46,263
but his resting place should be
someplace meaningful, don't you think?

432
00:20:46,388 --> 00:20:49,600
Why don't you take this up to Ottawa
and spread his ashes there.

433
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:53,311
And make sure you take a video,
and I'll e-mail blast it to everyone here.

434
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:55,647
So we can always remember
your great friendship.

435
00:20:55,731 --> 00:20:56,690
Everybody, stop!

436
00:20:56,774 --> 00:20:59,526
Henry Winkler is a stone-cold killer!

437
00:21:01,111 --> 00:21:02,487
What? I'm not a killer.

438
00:21:02,571 --> 00:21:06,074
Unless you mean killer of gloom,
because I bring joy everywhere I go.

439
00:21:06,157 --> 00:21:09,244
Did you mean "killer of gloom
because I bring joy everywhere I go"?

440
00:21:09,327 --> 00:21:10,829
You know that's not what I meant.

441
00:21:10,954 --> 00:21:13,624
You murdered Herb
so you could publish his book.

442
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:17,210
But we're not gonna let you
steal his legacy, Henry Winkler.

443
00:21:17,294 --> 00:21:20,631
I was afraid this would happen.

444
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:22,466
-Oh, no, he's got a gun!
-Oh, no!

445
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:23,592
What?

446
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:29,598
No, I have Herb's book.

447
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:34,185
I didn't kill Herb,
but I did steal his manuscript.

448
00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:36,146
-So that I could burn it.
-What?

449
00:21:36,229 --> 00:21:38,440
Because it's terrible.

450
00:21:38,523 --> 00:21:39,775
Well, I'll see for myself.

451
00:21:39,858 --> 00:21:44,279
"The air in 1830s California was fragrant
with the flowers of laughter

452
00:21:44,362 --> 00:21:45,781
and the smoke of adventure."

453
00:21:45,864 --> 00:21:47,198
-What?
-Uh.

454
00:21:47,282 --> 00:21:52,036
After he died, Tina and I agreed
we couldn't let the book get published.

455
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,790
It would have turned Herb
into a laughingstock.

456
00:21:54,873 --> 00:21:56,834
"The carpenter's boy was a hungry boy.

457
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,671
Hungry for crumpets.
But also hungry, dot, dot, dot, for life."

458
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:02,589
He literally wrote out "dot, dot, dot."

459
00:22:02,673 --> 00:22:06,510
I know there's no accounting for taste,
but come on.

460
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:11,515
He's right. Herb wanted a legacy,
but he already has one.

461
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,934
People loved Horsin' Around.
This would only ruin that.

462
00:22:15,018 --> 00:22:18,897
I'm sorry I accused you of murder,
American TV legend Henry Winkler.

463
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,691
No need to apologize.

464
00:22:20,774 --> 00:22:23,777
You ascribed a mystery to Herb's death
to give it meaning.

465
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:25,696
But there is no meaning in death.

466
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:28,239
That's why it's so terrifying.

467
00:22:28,323 --> 00:22:31,326
It was just easier to believe
that you killed him for his book

468
00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:33,953
than believe that he just died
for nothing.

469
00:22:34,078 --> 00:22:36,581
There is no shame in dying for nothing.

470
00:22:36,665 --> 00:22:38,124
That's why most people die.

471
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:41,670
I just wanted to fix things somehow.

472
00:22:41,753 --> 00:22:45,382
I'm sorry, Horse Guy, but you can't.

473
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:52,347
Wow, heady stuff.

474
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:53,891
But let's not get distracted

475
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:56,894
from what a true friend
Princess Carolyn is.

476
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:58,896
Don't forget the ashes, Princess Carolyn.

477
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:01,648
Fantastic.

478
00:23:07,863 --> 00:23:10,073
Hey. Special delivery.

479
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:11,909
Courtesy of the Toad-man.

480
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:15,328
Thanks. Hey, why'd you roll up
your sleeves like that? You look weird.

481
00:23:15,412 --> 00:23:17,831
Oh, I--

482
00:23:17,915 --> 00:23:20,291
Well, you know, I was--
I was trying out a new look.

483
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,627
It was-- It was a dumb idea.

484
00:23:22,711 --> 00:23:25,714
Yup. Whoa! Oh, no! Ow... Ow!

485
00:23:29,426 --> 00:23:31,261
-Here's your Squirt, sir.
-Thank you.

486
00:23:31,762 --> 00:23:34,472
And if that happens, I want you
to take care of each other.

487
00:23:34,598 --> 00:23:37,267
No matter what,
we're going to stick together.

488
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,852
-Congratulations!
-Hey, good job.

489
00:23:38,936 --> 00:23:41,855
-You've got a goddamn hit on your hands.
-Anyone got coke?

490
00:23:41,939 --> 00:23:45,692
ABC sent us limousines
to take us to the wrap party.

491
00:23:45,776 --> 00:23:48,570
I'm scared. I've never been in a limo.

492
00:23:48,653 --> 00:23:51,281
Don't worry. We'll take care of you.

493
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:54,451
-Seriously, no one has coke?
-Let's go.

494
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:56,327
You don't wanna go to the party?

495
00:23:56,411 --> 00:23:57,412
Nah.

496
00:23:57,495 --> 00:23:59,790
Hey, we never got a chance
to walk around the lot.

497
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:02,250
Wanna check out that water tank
where they filmed The Love Boat?

498
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:06,671
Are you kidding? I've always wanted
to get tanked in a tank.

499
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:09,299
--Shh.

500
00:24:09,382 --> 00:24:11,593
-Quiet. Be careful.
-Oh, okay, okay.

501
00:24:12,677 --> 00:24:14,345
You ready?

502
00:24:15,597 --> 00:24:18,391
-What?
-What--? The water's only two inches deep.

503
00:24:18,516 --> 00:24:20,268
Well, that's Hollywood for you.

504
00:24:22,604 --> 00:24:24,147
Hey.

505
00:24:24,355 --> 00:24:27,233
Are you scared at all?

506
00:24:27,317 --> 00:24:30,654
That if the show takes off,
everything's going to change?

507
00:24:30,737 --> 00:24:34,616
No, I'm not scared, BJ.
The future is bright.

508
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:36,910
Just look at it.

509
00:25:23,748 --> 00:25:27,044
Boxer versus raptor.
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.
