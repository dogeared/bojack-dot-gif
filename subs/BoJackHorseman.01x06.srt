1
00:00:06,868 --> 00:00:08,830
- Huh?
- Oh, uh, it's a pet name.

2
00:00:08,924 --> 00:00:11,093
I don't have actual honey.

3
00:00:11,176 --> 00:00:12,802
Diane!

4
00:00:12,886 --> 00:00:16,056
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter. Mwah.

5
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:17,766
BoJack Horseman!

6
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:19,601
- Put her there!
- That's all right.

7
00:00:19,684 --> 00:00:21,228
I'm gonna get that handshake.

8
00:00:21,311 --> 00:00:22,520
No, you're not.

9
00:00:22,604 --> 00:00:23,855
Since when am I Honey?

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,441
Since now.

11
00:00:25,523 --> 00:00:27,525
I made up the nickname
while you were back east.

12
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:29,903
Yeah, really? You made
up calling someone honey?

13
00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:31,529
Uh, I do believe so. Yes.

14
00:00:31,613 --> 00:00:33,282
Hey, why don't we give BoJack a ride?

15
00:00:33,365 --> 00:00:34,657
That's okay. Todd's supposed to pick me up.

16
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:36,076
Where is he?

17
00:00:37,911 --> 00:00:40,163
First day, huh?

18
00:00:40,247 --> 00:00:42,249
Well, stick with me.
You're gonna be just fi...

19
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:48,171
Probably just forgot, the lazy bum.

20
00:00:48,255 --> 00:00:50,299
Hey, I'll take the ride as
long as it's not as bumpy

21
00:00:50,382 --> 00:00:51,841
as that pilot's landing.

22
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:53,510
That was seriously very scary.

23
00:00:53,593 --> 00:00:55,553
- Hey...
- I'm just glad you were there,

24
00:00:55,637 --> 00:00:57,555
because I really would
have freaked out by myself.

25
00:00:57,639 --> 00:00:59,682
Be stiller, my beating heart.

26
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:01,435
Stiller crazy after all these years.

27
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:03,019
Did I miss something funny?

28
00:01:03,103 --> 00:01:05,230
- I love funny somethings.
- No, we were just laughing

29
00:01:05,314 --> 00:01:07,690
about this Ben Stiller
article from the plane.

30
00:01:07,774 --> 00:01:09,109
Ooh, he is the best.

31
00:01:09,192 --> 00:01:11,153
- What did it say?
- You wouldn't get it.

32
00:01:11,236 --> 00:01:13,696
Either you read Hemisphere's
Magazine, or you don't.

33
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,533
Hey, I might be crazy, because
this is such a dumb question,

34
00:01:16,616 --> 00:01:18,910
and I'm embarrassed to even ask,

35
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:23,457
but do I have anything to
worry about with you and Diane?

36
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,292
What?

37
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:28,128
What?

38
00:01:28,211 --> 00:01:29,754
Get out of here.

39
00:01:29,838 --> 00:01:32,048
I got to say, BoJack,

40
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:33,633
that is a relief.

41
00:01:33,716 --> 00:01:36,970
Ho-ho! Whoo!

42

43
00:02:31,774 --> 00:02:33,667
Hey, do you guys want to grab dinner?

44
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:34,961
Or at least some road sodas,

45
00:02:35,044 --> 00:02:36,754
so I don't have to go through the ordeal

46
00:02:36,837 --> 00:02:38,464
of sobering up and then having
to get drunk all over again?

47
00:02:38,547 --> 00:02:40,758
Oh, I actually already made special plans

48
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:42,093
for just the two of us.

49
00:02:42,176 --> 00:02:43,510
Oh, come on.

50
00:02:43,594 --> 00:02:45,012
You're the one who's always saying

51
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:46,889
you want to hang out with BoJack more,

52
00:02:46,973 --> 00:02:48,474
and how it's weird that BoJack
never returns your calls,

53
00:02:48,557 --> 00:02:50,310
and how I should hang up the phone

54
00:02:50,392 --> 00:02:52,019
because maybe BoJack's
trying to call you right now.

55
00:02:52,103 --> 00:02:53,687
Uh, okay.

56
00:02:53,771 --> 00:02:56,732
I guess we can make this work.

57
00:02:56,816 --> 00:02:58,609
Oh.

58
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:01,028
Oh, man. Remember that guy in 34-B?

59
00:03:01,112 --> 00:03:03,823
Do I? Can't stop remembering him.

60
00:03:03,906 --> 00:03:05,783
Uh, hey. Diane and I have memories, too.

61
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:08,535
This place reminds me of
a cliff side meal we had

62
00:03:08,619 --> 00:03:11,122
one romantic vacay to Cabo.

63
00:03:11,205 --> 00:03:12,498
Boring. I wasn't there.

64
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:14,917
Can we keep this general interests?

65
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:18,045
Well, here's to a meal we're all here for.

66
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:19,421
Mmm.

67
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:20,965
Oh, oh. Ew.

68
00:03:21,048 --> 00:03:22,216
There's something in my food.

69
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,425
Ah, crap. Someone get the manager.

70
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:25,178
No, no, no. Wait.

71
00:03:25,261 --> 00:03:28,014
It's supposed to be in
there. Welcome home, honey.

72
00:03:28,097 --> 00:03:32,601
I got you a D pendant,
because I am D-pendant on you.

73
00:03:32,685 --> 00:03:34,561
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Real... Real cute.

74
00:03:34,645 --> 00:03:37,231
- A D for dog.
- It's for Diane.

75
00:03:37,315 --> 00:03:40,901
This is the sweetest choking
hazard anyone's ever given me.

76
00:03:40,985 --> 00:03:42,903
Mwah.

77
00:03:42,987 --> 00:03:44,989
Well, how about some
champagne for the happy couple.

78
00:03:45,072 --> 00:03:46,907
Waiter, get me a bottle of Dom

79
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:49,451
to keep with the trend of sweet D gifts.

80
00:03:49,535 --> 00:03:51,120
You're too kind,

81
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:54,290
but everyone knows you go
off menu for the good stuff.

82
00:03:54,374 --> 00:03:56,959
Yes, get me your most
expensive bottle from the back.

83
00:03:57,043 --> 00:04:00,629
Perhaps a 1922-ISH Heidsieck Diamant Bleu?

84
00:04:00,713 --> 00:04:03,924
A toast on me to Diane
and Mr. Peanutbutter.

85
00:04:04,008 --> 00:04:05,926
I'd like a round of drinks for everyone.

86
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,428
Off the menu, of course.

87
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:10,597
BoJack, folks. What a sport.

88
00:04:10,681 --> 00:04:12,641
And while we're all in giving moods,

89
00:04:12,725 --> 00:04:16,270
I'd like to buy you all
an Xbox, courtesy of me.

90
00:04:17,688 --> 00:04:19,732
Wow. You guys don't have to do this.

91
00:04:19,815 --> 00:04:22,026
Look, I could happily
go down this petty road

92
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:23,277
of raising and re-raising one another.

93
00:04:23,361 --> 00:04:24,820
Please do!

94
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:26,488
But I'd instead like to highlight the fact

95
00:04:26,572 --> 00:04:28,324
that Mr. Peanutbutter's
ripping off my toast

96
00:04:28,408 --> 00:04:31,411
the same way he ripped
off my entire career.

97
00:04:31,493 --> 00:04:34,247
Uh, we prefer gifts over observations.

98
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,957
Okay. Well, here's
something I didn't rip off.

99
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,126
This brand new helicopter I just bought.

100
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,628
Whoo-whoo! Who wants
a ride in the chopper?

101
00:04:41,712 --> 00:04:43,923
Okay, guys. This has been fun,

102
00:04:44,006 --> 00:04:46,592
and also an offensive
display of extravagant wealth,

103
00:04:46,675 --> 00:04:48,052
but maybe we should call it a night.

104
00:04:48,135 --> 00:04:49,345
What's the rush?

105
00:04:49,429 --> 00:04:50,554
Because I just bought the restaurant,

106
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:52,181
and we can stay as long as we want.

107
00:04:52,265 --> 00:04:53,515
Hey, you. I own you now.

108
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:56,436
Do a dance.

109
00:04:59,688 --> 00:05:01,357
Oops.

110
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:02,900
Oh, no. Hey, sorry, bud.

111
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:05,069
- It's all yours.
- Please, you first.

112
00:05:05,152 --> 00:05:07,529
Apparently, we both like to be clean.

113
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:10,699
I love being clean. That's so coincidental.

114
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,410
- I'm Todd.
- Klaus.

115
00:05:12,493 --> 00:05:14,328
Look, I know you're new here,

116
00:05:14,412 --> 00:05:18,958
being white, into cleansing.

117
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,543
I think you'd enjoy hanging
out with me and the gang.

118
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:24,922
When you say "the gang,"
do you mean a gang?

119
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:26,466
Check this out. If you
want to lift weights,

120
00:05:26,548 --> 00:05:28,384
we got great yard connections.

121
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:30,677
If you like toilet wine,
we spent the past 20 years

122
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:32,263
perfecting pruno.

123
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:35,015
The Aryan nation is
number one for a reason.

124
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:36,476
Never thought I'd say this,

125
00:05:36,558 --> 00:05:38,769
but you put a pretty good spin on Nazis.

126
00:05:38,852 --> 00:05:40,562
Hey, tell you what. Drop
by our party tomorrow.

127
00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:42,815
Shoot the shit with the
guys, mostly about Jews,

128
00:05:42,898 --> 00:05:44,608
and make up your own mind.

129
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:46,319
Until then, take my card.

130
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:49,822
Whoa. Uh, where were you keeping that card?

131
00:05:49,905 --> 00:05:52,783
Forty-five, forty-six,

132
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:54,910
forty-seven...

133
00:05:54,994 --> 00:05:57,579
Guys, can we give this thing a rest?

134
00:05:57,663 --> 00:05:59,290
Rest? Why rest? I'm not tired.

135
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:00,960
I'm twice as not tired.

136
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:04,485
_

137
00:06:07,507 --> 00:06:11,260
Or D, sex and candy?

138
00:06:13,137 --> 00:06:14,472
BoJack!

139
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:16,265
Todd, where the hell have you been?

140
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:17,933
I had to carpool home from the airport

141
00:06:18,017 --> 00:06:19,810
like a goddamn environmentalist.

142
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:21,979
I'm sorry, but I'm in jail, dude.

143
00:06:22,062 --> 00:06:24,357
Well, you called the right
person, because I need your help

144
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,941
and you're my phone-a-friend.

145
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:28,944
Marie Curie won Nobel
prizes in which two sciences?

146
00:06:29,028 --> 00:06:30,530
A, chemistry and physics.

147
00:06:30,612 --> 00:06:33,574
- B, biology and physics...
- Oh, B! The answer's B!

148
00:06:33,657 --> 00:06:34,992
- It's A!
- Damn it, Todd!

149
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:36,536
This was life or death.

150
00:06:36,618 --> 00:06:38,662
Same with me. The bail's set at 50 bucks.

151
00:06:38,745 --> 00:06:40,747
I'll be here wai...

152
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:48,881
Yes! I am the champion of the games!

153
00:06:48,964 --> 00:06:51,008
Did you see that, Diane?

154
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:52,468
Diane?

155
00:06:52,552 --> 00:06:53,719
You win, old friend.

156
00:06:53,802 --> 00:06:55,221
Now if you'll excuse me,

157
00:06:55,304 --> 00:06:57,806
I'm going to take my girlfriend to bed.

158
00:06:59,475 --> 00:07:00,893
We're still out?

159
00:07:02,603 --> 00:07:03,854
Night, BoJack.

160
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:06,273
Good night, Diane.

161
00:07:06,357 --> 00:07:09,402
Give me a bottle of something
to help me forget my problems.

162
00:07:09,485 --> 00:07:11,237
Ooh, maybe not that strong.

163
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,988
What is this, breakfast?

164
00:07:13,072 --> 00:07:14,656
Yeah, that's about right.

165
00:07:21,747 --> 00:07:23,874
Well, that worked effectively.

166
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:26,043
It's a Holly-who-done-it

167
00:07:26,126 --> 00:07:27,628
as police are scrambling to figure out

168
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:30,464
who stole the D from
the famed Hollywood sign.

169
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:32,841
- Holly-what?
- All of Tinseltown's

170
00:07:32,925 --> 00:07:35,886
at DEFCON 5 until their
diabolically displaced D

171
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:38,347
is demonstrably displayed once more.

172
00:07:38,431 --> 00:07:40,015
Can we cool it with the alliteration?

173
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:42,768
Who wrote this copy? Randy, looking at you.

174
00:07:42,851 --> 00:07:44,437
Weird.

175
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,687
Weirder.

176
00:07:47,314 --> 00:07:49,149
Why the hell would I steal a giant D?

177
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:51,110
Ding-dong! It's Diane.

178
00:07:51,193 --> 00:07:53,737
D... D... Damn!

179
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,239
Meanwhile, local authorities

180
00:07:55,322 --> 00:07:56,949
are already investigating several suspects.

181
00:07:57,032 --> 00:07:59,493
David Duchovny, Dick Van Dyke, DMX,

182
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:02,413
and of course Dane Cook,
who we all know is a thief.

183
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:05,707
Hey, D-voted memoirist.

184
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,377
I can't work on the book
today. Too ill. Cough.

185
00:08:08,461 --> 00:08:10,337
Are you ill, or hung-over?

186
00:08:10,421 --> 00:08:12,839
Because instead of coughing
you just said the word cough.

187
00:08:12,923 --> 00:08:14,467
Plus you left me a long,
drunken voice-mail last night.

188
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,759
Ooh, was it bad?

189
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:17,052
It was mostly a lot of wheezing,

190
00:08:17,136 --> 00:08:18,596
as if you were climbing something,

191
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:20,222
followed by the sounds
of dismantling metal,

192
00:08:20,306 --> 00:08:21,723
and then grunting like you
were dragging something heavy

193
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:23,225
at least a few miles.

194
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:25,227
I didn't say anything incriminating, did I?

195
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:27,146
As incriminating as that question? No.

196
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:28,689
Good. Well, just as a general rule,

197
00:08:28,772 --> 00:08:29,898
you probably shouldn't be listening

198
00:08:29,982 --> 00:08:31,609
to any voicemails I leave after...

199
00:08:31,692 --> 00:08:33,277
- What time do I start drinking?
- Noon?

200
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,404
- Yup. See you later.
- But we had an appointment.

201
00:08:35,488 --> 00:08:37,531
What's that? An actor
flaking on an obligation?

202
00:08:37,615 --> 00:08:39,617
- Welcome to Hollywood.
- I think you mean Hollywoo.

203
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,743
Did you see? Someone
stole the D off the sign.

204
00:08:41,827 --> 00:08:43,078
Cough, cough, cough, cough, cough.

205
00:08:43,162 --> 00:08:45,498
Cough, cough, cough, cough, door slam.

206
00:08:45,581 --> 00:08:47,458
What is it, BoJack?

207
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,835
You know, I'm tied up
with all my Deans today.

208
00:08:49,918 --> 00:08:51,795
Kane, Norris, Winters, and Koontz,

209
00:08:51,878 --> 00:08:53,631
all being questioned by police.

210
00:08:53,714 --> 00:08:55,257
It was me. I stole the D.

211
00:08:55,341 --> 00:08:56,925
- What?
- Now be a good agent

212
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:58,177
and make this not my problem.

213
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,970
How did you even...?

214
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:02,222
You know, your scandal-to-work
ratio is, like, five to one.

215
00:09:02,306 --> 00:09:04,224
Look, I need to get rid of
this before Diane sees it.

216
00:09:04,308 --> 00:09:06,686
Why do you care if Dia... Oh, fish.

217
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:08,937
Are you in love with your biographer?

218
00:09:09,021 --> 00:09:11,064
What?

219
00:09:11,148 --> 00:09:13,567
What?

220
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:15,611
Get out of here.

221
00:09:15,695 --> 00:09:18,780
You stole the D for Diane. Unbelievable.

222
00:09:18,864 --> 00:09:20,407
Yeah, I don't know. The
D might be for David,

223
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:22,075
because apparently when I was drunk,

224
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:24,578
I printed out a bunch of
pictures of David Boreanaz.

225
00:09:24,662 --> 00:09:27,206
Yeah. You did that.

226
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:28,999
Look, I'll keep your little
crush busy long enough

227
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:30,501
for you to get rid of the contraband,

228
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:31,793
but the next three weddings I'm invited to,

229
00:09:31,877 --> 00:09:33,462
you're my date, dummy.

230
00:09:33,546 --> 00:09:36,089
Since when to women your
age get invited to weddings?

231
00:09:36,173 --> 00:09:37,383
I have a lot of nieces and nephews!

232
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,093
Well, you pulled it off,

233
00:09:40,177 --> 00:09:41,679
you deviant.

234
00:09:41,762 --> 00:09:44,390
Get it? D-viant?

235
00:09:44,473 --> 00:09:45,932
- I got it.
- Tell me,

236
00:09:46,016 --> 00:09:47,851
how are you gonna complete
your giant bracelet?

237
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:49,520
With the chain-link fence
from Dodger's Stadium?

238
00:09:49,603 --> 00:09:52,356
No. How'd you figure out it was me?

239
00:09:52,439 --> 00:09:55,067
Oh, how did I figure it out?
Well, I just followed the clues,

240
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,028
used deduction, puzzle-solving,
a little bit of forensics,

241
00:09:58,111 --> 00:09:59,780
and also, what did I do?

242
00:09:59,863 --> 00:10:02,074
Oh, I listened to the
voice-mail you left me

243
00:10:02,157 --> 00:10:04,618
saying you were stealing
the D because of Diane

244
00:10:04,702 --> 00:10:08,080
so I could, and I quote, "Suck your D."

245
00:10:08,163 --> 00:10:10,040
Stop leaving voicemails!

246
00:10:10,123 --> 00:10:12,292
Admit it! You like my girlfriend.

247
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:15,337
Oh, come on. I mean, am
I attracted to her? Sure.

248
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:17,548
Do my days feel better
when I'm around her? Yeah.

249
00:10:17,631 --> 00:10:20,384
Does she get me in ways no
woman ever has? Indubitably.

250
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:23,011
Do I fantasize about her?
Yes, but only in two positions.

251
00:10:23,095 --> 00:10:24,930
Look, am I the kind of
guy who would try to steal

252
00:10:25,013 --> 00:10:26,223
someone else's girlfriend?

253
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:27,808
Sure, of course, but do I like her?

254
00:10:27,891 --> 00:10:30,227
The answer's no. You have
nothing to worry about.

255
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,812
I'll cut you a deal.

256
00:10:31,895 --> 00:10:33,647
I help you get rid of that D,

257
00:10:33,731 --> 00:10:36,650
and you never talk to Diane again.

258
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:39,486
Well, I have to talk to her,
because she's writing my book.

259
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,573
Okay, but just don't
pursue her romantically?

260
00:10:42,656 --> 00:10:44,366
- Deal.
- Ha!

261
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,453
- I knew I'd get that handshake.
- I regret this already.

262
00:10:49,913 --> 00:10:54,418
Spread them wide, ladies.
This is a random cavity search.

263
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:57,045
Whoa! Buy a guy a drink first.

264
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:59,005
Did we just say that...

265
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:00,966
- Oh!
- At the same time?

266
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:03,719
Look, I saw you talking
to Klaus in the shower.

267
00:11:03,803 --> 00:11:06,847
Now, the Aryan's are good
guys. Don't get me wrong.

268
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,140
But I don't know if you're gonna get

269
00:11:08,223 --> 00:11:10,016
the right attention over there.

270
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,352
Uh, I'd hate to get
lost in a shop that big.

271
00:11:12,436 --> 00:11:14,271
Now we can't offer you the works,

272
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:16,482
but in the Latin Kings, you'll be a star.

273
00:11:16,565 --> 00:11:20,068
We're number two, and
that means we try harder.

274
00:11:20,152 --> 00:11:22,571
Am I really being courted by two gangs?

275
00:11:22,655 --> 00:11:25,449
Oh, I feel like the belle of the ball.

276
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:29,662
So, this is the shapeless biographer

277
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:31,413
I've heard so much about.

278
00:11:31,497 --> 00:11:33,915
We've met several times.

279
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:35,751
Did you just call me here to insult me?

280
00:11:35,835 --> 00:11:37,377
What is your secret, lady?

281
00:11:37,461 --> 00:11:39,839
I mean, how do you get two
grown men fighting over you

282
00:11:39,921 --> 00:11:41,841
like a foul ball at a football game?

283
00:11:41,923 --> 00:11:43,592
First of all, football
doesn't have foul balls.

284
00:11:43,676 --> 00:11:45,093
Ugh, sports.

285
00:11:45,177 --> 00:11:47,763
Second of all, nobody's fighting over me.

286
00:11:47,847 --> 00:11:49,097
Open your eyes.

287
00:11:49,181 --> 00:11:50,974
BoJack's clearly in love with you.

288
00:11:51,057 --> 00:11:56,647
Wha...?

289
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,190
Get out of here!

290
00:11:58,273 --> 00:11:59,817
Get out of here? Why
would I get out of here?

291
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,985
You get out of here. This is my office.

292
00:12:04,446 --> 00:12:05,865
I get the army men are police,

293
00:12:05,906 --> 00:12:07,449
but what's the mustard packet again?

294
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:09,284
Oh, that's just a mustard packet.

295
00:12:09,368 --> 00:12:10,870
- It's left over from lunch.
- Oh.

296
00:12:10,952 --> 00:12:12,287
Well, can we move it off the table?

297
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:13,622
No. I still might want it later.

298
00:12:13,706 --> 00:12:14,874
Good call.

299
00:12:14,956 --> 00:12:16,876
So how do we get the D from here

300
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,627
all the way up to here?

301
00:12:18,711 --> 00:12:20,337
What, with all these cops and mustards,

302
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,922
- it's gonna be a pickle.
- Oh, no.

303
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:23,632
The pickle's a SWAT van,
but I see your point.

304
00:12:23,716 --> 00:12:27,887
Might be easier to just
ditch the evidence. But how?

305
00:12:27,969 --> 00:12:29,513
I... I don't know.

306
00:12:29,596 --> 00:12:31,640
You think these coffees
would get the juices flowing.

307
00:12:31,724 --> 00:12:33,016
Well, they do have Bailey's in them.

308
00:12:33,099 --> 00:12:34,727
Is that why I feel drunk?

309
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,812
Because I've had, like,
seven or eight coffees.

310
00:12:36,896 --> 00:12:38,355
I mean, I admit, it's been bad for ideas,

311
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:40,357
but it's been great for camaraderie.

312
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,942
Couldn't agree more.

313
00:12:42,025 --> 00:12:43,610
Ooh, hey. What time is it?

314
00:12:43,694 --> 00:12:45,195
I probably need to move my helicopter.

315
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:46,697
It's in a two-hour zone.

316
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,949
You beautiful bastard, that's it!

317
00:12:49,032 --> 00:12:51,952
We can pick up the D with your
chopper, fly it out of here,

318
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:53,537
and then dump it out into the ocean.

319
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,955
Stupendous!

320
00:12:55,038 --> 00:12:56,749
Take that, the ocean.

321
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,794
- What now, Todd?
- Listen.

322
00:13:00,878 --> 00:13:04,047
So, kind of landed myself in a
two-dates-to-the-prom situation.

323
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,384
The dates being prison gangs
and the prom being a jump-in,

324
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:09,595
so do you remember how
you got out of the same jam

325
00:13:09,678 --> 00:13:10,846
on Horsin' Around?

326
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,098
Ah, a classic conundrum.

327
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:15,935
Well, I recall one time on
Mr. Peanutbutter's House...

328
00:13:16,017 --> 00:13:17,269
I think he's talking to me, pal.

329
00:13:17,352 --> 00:13:18,729
You know, the guy whose show

330
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:21,022
invented the
two-dates-to-the-prom story.

331
00:13:21,106 --> 00:13:24,150
You may have invented it, but
I think our show perfected it.

332
00:13:24,234 --> 00:13:25,778
The only thing you ever perfected

333
00:13:25,861 --> 00:13:27,613
- was stealing my thunder.
- Stealing your thunder, eh?

334
00:13:27,696 --> 00:13:29,489
Now you're even stealing
the words I'm saying.

335
00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:31,074
You know, it's tough.

336
00:13:31,157 --> 00:13:33,911
I agree with the Latin
Kings on social issues,

337
00:13:33,994 --> 00:13:35,621
but fiscally I'm more of an Aryan.

338
00:13:35,704 --> 00:13:37,456
Well, juggling both never ends well.

339
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:39,332
Mr. Peanutbutter, anything to contribute?

340
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,209
He's just staring blankly now.

341
00:13:41,293 --> 00:13:44,964
Stealing your thunder.

342
00:13:45,046 --> 00:13:47,674
You could also just bail
me out of here, as I said.

343
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:49,050
- It's only 50 bucks...
- Got to go, pal.

344
00:13:49,134 --> 00:13:50,427
Hope it's a magical night.

345
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,678
All right, you ready for the plan?

346
00:13:51,762 --> 00:13:53,472
Oh, yeah.

347
00:13:53,555 --> 00:13:55,808
But we are gonna need a big distraction

348
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:58,226
to keep the eyes off the skies.

349
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,895
You leave that to me.

350
00:13:59,979 --> 00:14:01,855
Whoa, wait. You had a lot to drink.

351
00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:04,149
You better have a cup of coffee.

352
00:14:07,486 --> 00:14:09,237
Who loves you, people?

353
00:14:09,321 --> 00:14:11,323
Look this way, news media.

354
00:14:11,406 --> 00:14:14,785
A celebrity is throwing
away his hard-earned cash.

355
00:14:14,868 --> 00:14:16,286
Everyone pay attention to me.

356
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:18,872
Oh, it's only one-dollar bills, folks.

357
00:14:18,956 --> 00:14:20,248
Don't bother.

358
00:14:20,332 --> 00:14:22,292
No, it's still free, spendable money.

359
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,085
This is a huge story.

360
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:25,629
Dollars are like the new penny.

361
00:14:25,712 --> 00:14:28,131
Yeah. Cash is for poor people.

362
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:29,633
What is wrong with you bozos?

363
00:14:29,716 --> 00:14:32,218
Just riot over the damn money already.

364
00:14:32,302 --> 00:14:33,887
Well, nothing to see here, I guess.

365
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:35,096

366
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,348

368
00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:39,935
Oh, my God.

369
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:41,812
American singer-songwriter
Beyoncé is hurt.

370
00:14:41,895 --> 00:14:43,772
Somebody help her!

371
00:14:43,856 --> 00:14:45,941
Ring the alarm. Irreplaceable pop icon

372
00:14:46,025 --> 00:14:48,401
and independent woman
Beyoncé has been injured.

373
00:14:48,485 --> 00:14:49,778
What more can you give us?

374
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:51,363
Details are sketchy at this point,

375
00:14:51,446 --> 00:14:53,532
but we do know Beyoncé is a survivor,

376
00:14:53,615 --> 00:14:56,326
and presumably she will keep on surviving.

377
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:57,995
- But what happened?
- Well, Tom,

378
00:14:58,078 --> 00:14:59,788
I'm being told she fell
on all the single dollars.

379
00:14:59,872 --> 00:15:01,665
- All the single dollars?
- All the single dollars.

380
00:15:01,748 --> 00:15:03,208
All the single dollars?

381
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,961
- All the single dollars.
- Bills, bills, bills.

382
00:15:06,045 --> 00:15:08,296
We promise to provide
live, unflinching coverage

383
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,173
of this harrowing ordeal

384
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:12,718
of a star gone from dangerously in love

385
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:14,636
to dangerously in peril.

386
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,389
Don't stop watching.

387
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:20,308
Mr. Peanutbutter, take her home.

388
00:15:27,941 --> 00:15:29,150
Doctors have confirmed

389
00:15:29,234 --> 00:15:32,445
that Beyoncé will never perform again.

390
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:36,116
This just in. A break in the
story of the Hollywoo heist.

391
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:38,702
We now go live to the
house of Mr. Peanutbutter,

392
00:15:38,785 --> 00:15:41,038
star of Mr. Peanutbutter's House.

393
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:43,415
Ah, jeez. What did that idiot do?

394
00:15:43,498 --> 00:15:45,166
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,

395
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:49,504
I, and I alone, stole the
D from the Hollywoo sign.

396
00:15:51,256 --> 00:15:53,174
Just tell us, why'd you do it?

397
00:15:53,258 --> 00:15:54,551
Oh, I'll tell you why.

398
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:57,387
I did it all for my girlfriend, Diane.

399
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,347
Aww.

400
00:15:59,431 --> 00:16:01,266
Son of a bitch.

401
00:16:01,349 --> 00:16:04,436
That literal son of a bitch.

402
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:07,397
If you're joining us, Mr.
Peanutbutter has confessed

403
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,316
to stealing the D for his girlfriend Diane

404
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,070
in what many are calling
the most romantic gesture

405
00:16:13,153 --> 00:16:15,196
in the history of romance and gestures.

406
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,074
We now await the L.A.P.D.'s move.

407
00:16:17,157 --> 00:16:21,078
The day they make love a crime
is the day I turn in my badge.

408
00:16:23,288 --> 00:16:26,125
And here's our lady of the hour now, Diane.

409
00:16:26,207 --> 00:16:28,376
Diane! What do you think?

410
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:32,839
Wow, Mr. Peanutbutter,
uh, it's kind of a lot.

411
00:16:32,923 --> 00:16:34,800
I don't really like to be on camera.

412
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:36,551
And?

413
00:16:36,635 --> 00:16:39,930
Do you love anything or anyone?

414
00:16:40,013 --> 00:16:42,141
I got to go. We'll talk about it later.

415
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,106
♪ Ooh ♪

416
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:51,566
Oh, my Todd.

417
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,945
You look... You look beautiful, holmes.

418
00:16:55,028 --> 00:16:57,030
What? This old thing?

419
00:16:57,156 --> 00:16:58,323
The guards made me wear it.

420
00:16:58,406 --> 00:17:00,159
Yeah, well, it suits you.

421
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:01,743
You're an autumn, bro.

422
00:17:03,244 --> 00:17:04,370
Ahh.

423
00:17:04,454 --> 00:17:06,498
It's good, right?

424
00:17:06,581 --> 00:17:08,249
Oh.

425
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,793
Come meet my boy, Santiago.

426
00:17:09,876 --> 00:17:11,419
Uh, you know, I'll... I'll be right back.

427
00:17:11,503 --> 00:17:13,005
I... I left my cot unmade.

428
00:17:13,088 --> 00:17:14,965
Ooh, watch it.

429
00:17:15,048 --> 00:17:16,800
Oh, sorry I'm late.

430
00:17:16,883 --> 00:17:19,803
Hope you didn't think I was
pulling an Anne Frank on you.

431
00:17:19,886 --> 00:17:22,181
Good one.

432
00:17:23,556 --> 00:17:24,808
Can you believe it?

433
00:17:24,891 --> 00:17:26,351
I was double-crossed by the one man

434
00:17:26,434 --> 00:17:29,270
I assumed was too stupid
to even single-cross.

435
00:17:29,354 --> 00:17:31,356
What? I have no idea
what you're talking about.

436
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:33,358
I do have a life outside of you, you know.

437
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:36,153
Mr. Peanutbutter took my
D and gave it to Diane.

438
00:17:36,236 --> 00:17:38,697
Once again, he completely ripped me off.

439
00:17:38,822 --> 00:17:40,866
Oh, right. That whole thing.

440
00:17:40,949 --> 00:17:42,283
Just a minute, Cate.

441
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:44,203
Look, you may have come up with a log line,

442
00:17:44,285 --> 00:17:45,829
but he's the one who sold the pitch.

443
00:17:45,912 --> 00:17:47,706
This is more on brand for
him than it is for you.

444
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:49,374
- What do you mean?
- Desecrated a major landmark

445
00:17:49,457 --> 00:17:52,127
in a drunken stupor, that's
a BoJack Horseman thing.

446
00:17:52,211 --> 00:17:53,670
But stealing it for your girlfriend

447
00:17:53,753 --> 00:17:55,421
as a grand display of affection?

448
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:57,257
That's Mr. Peanutbutter.

449
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,677
You're right. It's Mr.
Peanutbutter all over.

450
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,387
It's the kind of bold, romantic gesture

451
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,056
they base movies on.

452
00:18:04,139 --> 00:18:05,557
Actually, that's not a bad idea.

453
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,309
Lora? Check if anyone's
bought the rights yet.

454
00:18:08,393 --> 00:18:09,644
Can we keep this about me, please?

455
00:18:09,728 --> 00:18:11,479
Even if he stole your stealing of the D,

456
00:18:11,563 --> 00:18:14,315
what he made his was
telling Diane how he felt

457
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,525
from his heart.

458
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:16,902
You could never say it to me,

459
00:18:16,985 --> 00:18:18,486
and you still can't say it to her.

460
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,530
That's not true. I can express feelings.

461
00:18:20,613 --> 00:18:24,659
Nothing on the outside.
Nothing on the inside.

462
00:18:24,743 --> 00:18:26,411
Look, I got to bounce.
Quick question, though.

463
00:18:26,494 --> 00:18:29,414
Would you see Cate Blanchett
in a movie about Eva Braun?

464
00:18:29,497 --> 00:18:31,083
Why are you wasting my time with this?

465
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:34,211
- Of course I would. Who wouldn't?
- Huh.

466
00:18:36,088 --> 00:18:38,048
And that's why Eva Braun

467
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:40,508
was like the fifth
Beatle of the Third Reich.

468
00:18:40,592 --> 00:18:46,639
Wow. I never knew neo-Nazis
were so interested in Nazis.

469
00:18:46,723 --> 00:18:48,433
You got some great moves, Todd.

470
00:18:48,516 --> 00:18:51,978
You dance like a white man, and I love it.

471
00:18:52,062 --> 00:18:53,980
Hey, no disrespect,

472
00:18:54,064 --> 00:18:57,234
but I got a few chess pieces
I forgot need whittling.

473
00:18:57,317 --> 00:18:58,568
Oh, excuse me.

474
00:18:58,651 --> 00:19:00,904
Oh, thank God you're back.

475
00:19:00,987 --> 00:19:03,406
I was getting nervous that
you left me for another gang.

476
00:19:06,034 --> 00:19:08,578
If that happened, I'd have to kill you.

477
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:15,919
Thank you for rescheduling

478
00:19:16,002 --> 00:19:18,213
given your recent, uh, everything.

479
00:19:18,297 --> 00:19:20,966
Yeah. That was really something.

480
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:23,969
I guess he makes your heart stand Stiller?

481
00:19:24,052 --> 00:19:26,805
Yeah, but for some reason
the jury's Stiller out

482
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:28,431
on how I feel about it.

483
00:19:28,514 --> 00:19:30,350
Well, that's because it wasn't for you.

484
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:33,019
That wasn't a Diane thing. It
was a Mr. Peanutbutter thing.

485
00:19:33,103 --> 00:19:35,105
Well, what would be a Diane thing?

486
00:19:35,188 --> 00:19:37,649
A Diane thing would be something that shows

487
00:19:37,732 --> 00:19:39,567
he really knows you,

488
00:19:39,651 --> 00:19:42,821
like giving you an iPod loaded
with all your favorite podcasts,

489
00:19:42,904 --> 00:19:44,447
or a practical houseplant,

490
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,283
or surprising you with a bound album

491
00:19:46,366 --> 00:19:47,993
of photos and emails he saved.

492
00:19:48,076 --> 00:19:50,829
That's... That's what the
Diane I know would want.

493
00:19:50,912 --> 00:19:52,080
What are you saying to me?

494
00:19:52,164 --> 00:19:53,581
Just that you should be

495
00:19:53,665 --> 00:19:55,041
with someone who knows you.

496
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,252
Yeah? Like who?

497
00:19:57,336 --> 00:19:59,129
I...

498
00:19:59,212 --> 00:20:00,672
Whoa, were we... Were we taping?

499
00:20:00,755 --> 00:20:02,090
Um, okay.

500
00:20:02,174 --> 00:20:03,842
Uh, you want to hear my Andy Dick story?

501
00:20:03,925 --> 00:20:05,468
It's a doozie.

502
00:20:07,137 --> 00:20:10,182
All we ask for is 10% of anything pilfered.

503
00:20:10,265 --> 00:20:12,392
Drugs, cigarettes.

504
00:20:12,475 --> 00:20:14,060
I mean, that's the standard gang rate.

505
00:20:14,144 --> 00:20:19,565
Hey, I got to go, uh, do a prison thing.

506
00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:22,694
That sounds legitimate. We
are in prison, after all.

507
00:20:24,863 --> 00:20:26,531
Whew. Hey.

508
00:20:26,614 --> 00:20:28,825
White people, right?

509
00:20:28,908 --> 00:20:31,828
Todd? Why in the name of Pat Buchanan

510
00:20:31,911 --> 00:20:33,997
are you dressed like a Latin King?

511
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,540
- Uh, what...
- What the hell, bro?

512
00:20:35,623 --> 00:20:37,542
- Are you playing both sides?
- Look, guys,

513
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:41,004
I didn't want to choose between
you because I like you both.

514
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,173
Look, in fact, if you just took the time

515
00:20:43,256 --> 00:20:46,092
to get to know each
other the way you did me,

516
00:20:46,176 --> 00:20:48,594
I think you'd agree we
don't need gangs anymore

517
00:20:48,678 --> 00:20:53,558
because, deep down, we're all just people.

518
00:20:53,641 --> 00:20:55,394
What do you say?

519
00:20:55,476 --> 00:20:58,021
This just in. A standoff at the Super Max

520
00:20:58,104 --> 00:21:00,940
has turned into a full-on race war.

521
00:21:01,024 --> 00:21:04,277
But first, America has fallen
in love with Hollywoo it-couple,

522
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:06,529
Mr. Peanutbutter and Diane...

523
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,079
Diane? Is that you?

524
00:21:15,914 --> 00:21:18,333
Hey. It's, um, me.

525
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:22,128
Look, uh, things got a bit weird earlier,

526
00:21:22,212 --> 00:21:24,714
so I... I want to make sure
that we're still on for tomorrow

527
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:27,217
to talk about the time I
sneezed on Marisa Tomei.

528
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,052
I'm really sorry about before.

529
00:21:29,135 --> 00:21:30,803
I know the D was overkill,

530
00:21:30,887 --> 00:21:33,432
so I got you something more personal.

531
00:21:33,514 --> 00:21:34,849
Aww.

532
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:37,643
I also wanted to just, um, let you know

533
00:21:37,727 --> 00:21:39,979
how much I appreciate you
working on this book with me.

534
00:21:41,356 --> 00:21:45,235
I know I sometimes get carried away,

535
00:21:45,318 --> 00:21:47,028
but it's because I love you so much.

536
00:21:47,112 --> 00:21:48,988
You're a catch, Diane,

537
00:21:49,114 --> 00:21:51,824
and I think you know how much I love catch.

538
00:21:51,908 --> 00:21:54,369
And I'm sorry if I've
been difficult in any way

539
00:21:54,453 --> 00:21:56,121
during this process.

540
00:21:56,204 --> 00:21:57,830
You know, it's... It's
really hard to have somebody,

541
00:21:57,914 --> 00:22:00,500
I don't know, know you, I guess.

542
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,044
And you do, uh, know me, Diane.

543
00:22:03,128 --> 00:22:05,713
We're very different,
but I think we bring out

544
00:22:05,797 --> 00:22:07,340
the best in each other.

545
00:22:07,424 --> 00:22:09,050
It's like you're chocolate and I'm...

546
00:22:09,134 --> 00:22:10,927
- Peanutbutter?
- What? Now see?

547
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:13,221
That was so much better
than what I was gonna say.

548
00:22:13,305 --> 00:22:16,349
I was gonna say carrots.

549
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:17,976
And I know I'm not the perfect guy.

550
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:21,438
I actually kind of hate
myself a lot of the time.

551
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:25,275
But when... When I'm with
you, I, uh, don't hate myself.

552
00:22:25,358 --> 00:22:27,735
I like being around you,

553
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:29,279
and I don't know if I ever told you that

554
00:22:29,404 --> 00:22:32,240
in so many words, so I'm telling you.

555
00:22:32,324 --> 00:22:35,368
Diane, I've got an
important question to ask.

556
00:22:35,452 --> 00:22:38,955
No cameras, no big spectacle.

557
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,957
Just me and you.

558
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,417
Call me back.

559
00:22:42,501 --> 00:22:44,377
This was BoJack, by the way.

560
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:45,962
Horseman, obviously.

561
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:47,880
Will you do the honor...

562
00:22:49,215 --> 00:22:51,259
Of becoming Mrs. Peanutbutter?

563
00:22:51,343 --> 00:22:55,347
Wow. This is happening so fast.

564
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,849
Yes. I'll marry you.

565
00:22:57,932 --> 00:22:59,351
But I'm keeping my last name.

566
00:22:59,434 --> 00:23:02,187
You hear that? She said yes!

567
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,604
Let's kick it!

568
00:23:03,688 --> 00:23:05,606
Erica, did you hear she said yes?

569
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,443
Come on in here! All right!

570
00:23:10,611 --> 00:23:13,365
She's not gonna call. Get
out the consolation scotch.

571
00:23:15,033 --> 00:23:16,576
It's her! Make that celebration scotch.

572
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:18,870
- What's the difference?
- It's the same scotch!

573
00:23:18,953 --> 00:23:20,121
Diane! Hey, you!

574
00:23:20,205 --> 00:23:21,873
Hey.

575
00:23:21,956 --> 00:23:23,666
So this is weird.

576
00:23:23,749 --> 00:23:26,461
I'm engaged.

577
00:23:26,545 --> 00:23:28,547
Oh, wow.

578
00:23:28,629 --> 00:23:30,549
To Mr. Peanutbutter?

579
00:23:30,631 --> 00:23:32,884
I saw you left me a voice-mail...

580
00:23:32,967 --> 00:23:34,844
Delete it. It's just a
drunken recipe for Bundt cake.

581
00:23:34,927 --> 00:23:36,095
Not important.

582
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:37,556
Okay. I got to go.

583
00:23:37,638 --> 00:23:39,224
They're about to move the D back.

584
00:23:39,307 --> 00:23:41,934
- See you tomorrow?
- Absolutely.

585
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:47,732
Well, nobody knows me like you.

586
00:23:50,735 --> 00:23:52,987
Time to bring this baby home.

587
00:23:53,071 --> 00:23:55,156
To think I went from flying
missions over Kandahar

588
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,242
to this cushy crap.

589
00:23:58,784 --> 00:24:00,203
I spoke too soon!

590
00:24:00,286 --> 00:24:02,830
Black Hawk down! Black Hawk down!

591
00:24:02,914 --> 00:24:05,584
See, you guys aren't so different.

592
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:13,633
We're free! We're free!

593
00:24:13,716 --> 00:24:14,926
- Yeah!
- Freedom!

594
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:17,011
- I am free!
- Freedom!

595
00:24:17,095 --> 00:24:19,097
Oh, wow.

596
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,765
What a twist, huh?

597
00:24:20,848 --> 00:24:24,477
