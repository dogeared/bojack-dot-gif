Who wants chocolate chip pancakes?

3
00:00:07,731 --> 00:00:09,190
I do! I do!

4
00:00:09,273 --> 00:00:11,735
Ethan, didn't you
already eat your pancakes?

5
00:00:11,817 --> 00:00:14,696
As Oliver North would
say, "I do not recall."

6
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:18,115
Hey, where's Sabrina?

7
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:21,202
<i>Not hiding under the
table, that's for sure.</i>

8
00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:22,746
Aww...

9
00:00:22,828 --> 00:00:25,790
Why don't you guys leave this one to me?

10
00:00:25,873 --> 00:00:28,042
Why aren't you dressed
for school, prickly muffin?

11
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:30,002
I'm scared. Olivia told me

12
00:00:30,086 --> 00:00:32,463
sometimes, at school
they have pop quizzes.

13
00:00:32,547 --> 00:00:35,007
I don't want to pop!

14
00:00:35,091 --> 00:00:37,552
That's too much, man.

15
00:00:39,345 --> 00:00:42,890
Sabrina, nobody's popping on my watch.

16
00:00:42,973 --> 00:00:45,226
You stick with me, and I promise you,

17
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:47,604
everything's gonna be just fine.

18
00:00:47,687 --> 00:00:50,981
- Cut, boom in the shot.
- What? I'll be in my trailer.

19
00:00:52,316 --> 00:00:54,318
Nah, I'm just horsin' around.

20
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,531
You folks enjoying the show?

21
00:00:58,615 --> 00:01:01,701
And how about Sara Lynn as
Sabrina? Isn't she wonderful?

22
00:01:01,785 --> 00:01:04,746
Oh. Thank you.

23
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:07,206
Sarah Lynn.
You remember that name.

24
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,541
Back to one, everybody.

25
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,460
- Hey, you see those people?
- Yeah.

26
00:01:10,543 --> 00:01:11,919
Well, those boobs and jerk wads

27
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:13,504
are the best friends you'll ever have.

28
00:01:13,588 --> 00:01:15,465
Without them, you're nothing.
Remember that.

<i>Let's take it back to "prickly muffin."</i>

Your family will never understand you,

31
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,638
your lovers will leave
you or try to change you,

32
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:24,641
but your fans, you be good to them,
and they'll be good to you.

33
00:01:24,724 --> 00:01:26,684
We are rolling. Sound speed.

34
00:01:26,768 --> 00:01:29,145
The most important thing is,
you got to give the people

35
00:01:29,228 --> 00:01:31,272
what they want, even if it kills you,

36
00:01:31,355 --> 00:01:34,150
even if it empties you out until
there's nothing left to empty.

37
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:36,527
No matter what happens, no
matter how much it hurts,

38
00:01:36,611 --> 00:01:39,739
you don't stop dancing,
and you don't stop smiling,

39
00:01:39,823 --> 00:01:42,408
and you give those
people what they want.

40
00:01:42,492 --> 00:01:44,118
<i>And action.</i>

00:01:49,165 --> 00:01:51,876
You might remember
her as adorable Sabrina

43
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:55,045
from Horsin' Around, but
on her new dance pop album,

America needs to know that I'm
not that little girl anymore.

51
00:02:20,112 --> 00:02:23,062
I'm a grown up,
sophisticated woman now,

52
00:02:23,063 --> 00:02:25,660
and I have sex, and I do sexy things.

53
00:02:25,743 --> 00:02:31,374
People like sex, okay, and since
I'm sexy right now, they like me.

54
00:02:31,457 --> 00:02:33,543
Are you at all worried that
audiences will grow bored

55
00:02:33,626 --> 00:02:35,586
and abandon you for the next sexy thing?

56
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,297
Are you kidding?
I'm Sarah freaking Lynn.

celebrates her 30th birthday this month,

60
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:49,225
raising the question, "does anyone care

61
00:02:49,308 --> 00:02:52,645
about Sarah Lynn anymore?"
After all, she is 30.

62
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:54,397
Here to answer that question,

63
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,192
sexy, 14-year-old dubstep
wunderkind, Sextina Aquafina.

64
00:02:58,275 --> 00:03:00,027
Hey!

65
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,779
Sextina, what's your take?

66
00:03:01,863 --> 00:03:04,615
I love Sarah Lynn. I grew
up on her music, okay,

67
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:07,243
and she's, like, an
inspiration, but now, she is old,

68
00:03:07,326 --> 00:03:09,537
and shriveled, and gross, and
nobody want her no more, okay?

69
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,750
- They want Sextina Aquafina, baby!
- Ha ha! You're delightful.

70
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,293
So where does Sarah Lynn go from here?

71
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:18,170
Oh, you know where she should go?

72
00:03:18,254 --> 00:03:20,997
She should go wherever
famous people go when they're

73
00:03:20,998 --> 00:03:23,843
done being famous, and nobody
cares if they live or die.

74
00:03:25,845 --> 00:03:28,556
Who could that be?

you'd make me chocolate chip pancakes.

Oh, come on, buddy.

It's a beautiful morning,

- birds are chirping...
- Hey, BoJack,

83
00:04:41,796 --> 00:04:43,798
- any plans for the weekend?
- Still hate the troops, Boj?

84

- Why don't you refill your bird feeder, huh?
- Yeah, who's a bird got to blow

85
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,803
- to get some seed around here?
- Good one.

86
00:04:48,886 --> 00:04:50,930
Let's do something fun today.

00:05:01,398 --> 00:05:03,275
Wow, everything in this store is made

90
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,653
out of old train tracks
and a reclaimed pier.

91
00:05:05,736 --> 00:05:08,280
Oh, great, for ten grand,
I can sleep like a hobo.

92
00:05:08,364 --> 00:05:09,532
Do we need letter openers

00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:13,577

- Ugh.

98
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:24,964
Yeah, it's me,
straight off your TV screens

99
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:26,549
and into your shitty lives.

- And what's your name, darling?
- I... mm...

103
00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:39,645
I'll just make it out to "Evelyn."

104

Uh...

00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,495
- Um, hi. Sarah Lynn, hi.
- BoJack? Hey.

106
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,863
Andrew, this is BoJack, my TV dad.

107
00:05:48,988 --> 00:05:50,990
Oh, hello, I'm Andrew Garfield.

108
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:54,535
Andrew's my boyfriend.
We're a celebrity power couple.

109
00:05:54,618 --> 00:05:55,953
It's no big deal.

110
00:05:56,037 --> 00:05:57,830
<i> It's a really big deal.</i>

111
00:05:57,914 --> 00:06:00,249
Sarah Lynn, I actually wanted
to talk to you about that.

112
00:06:00,332 --> 00:06:02,459
When we started dating,
you were the biggest star

113
00:06:02,543 --> 00:06:05,212
in the world, but your
last few albums tanked,

114
00:06:05,295 --> 00:06:08,841
so now, I don't even
know what you are anymore.

115
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:12,636
Are you...
Are you breaking up with me?

116
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,306
- Oh, bother.
- Um, are those candy pills,

117
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,225
'cause if so, that is a lot of sugar.

118
00:06:18,308 --> 00:06:19,936
Why are you doing this to me?!

119
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:22,646
Do you like seeing me suffer?

120
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,942
Because you know I'll bleed for you.

121
00:06:27,276 --> 00:06:28,444
- Oh!
- Damn!

122
00:06:28,527 --> 00:06:31,155
- Oh, dear.
- Whoa-oh-oh. Um...

123
00:06:31,238 --> 00:06:33,407
Darling, please, I wanted
to do this in a public place

124
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,076
so you wouldn't make a scene.

125
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:38,245
You think I won't make a
scene, you limey bastard?

126
00:06:38,328 --> 00:06:41,831
Then you really don't know me at all.
Hey, everyone!

127
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:46,211
Who wants to see me
take a dump on that sofa?

128
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:49,132
And then she took a dump on a sofa

129
00:06:49,214 --> 00:06:50,466
made out of a reclaimed propeller.

130
00:06:50,549 --> 00:06:52,342
Where's Sarah Lynn now?

131
00:06:52,426 --> 00:06:55,012
I checked her into Promises.
28 days, she'll be good as new.

132
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:57,723
How did it feel to check the girl
you raised on television into rehab?

133
00:06:57,807 --> 00:07:00,726
It was tough.
I would have liked to reconnect with her.

134
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,937
At least we got to bond a
little on the drive to Malibu.

135
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,064
I can see my organs.

136
00:07:05,148 --> 00:07:08,567
Oh, whoa! She is losing
a lot of blood, BoJack.

137
00:07:08,651 --> 00:07:10,486
Beautiful day for a drive, though, huh?

138
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:12,113
Well, maybe the two of you

139
00:07:12,196 --> 00:07:14,031
can catch up some more
when she gets out of rehab.

140
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:16,742
People don't usually want to
hang out with me after rehab.

141
00:07:16,826 --> 00:07:19,203
I'm really more of a before-rehab friend.

142
00:07:19,286 --> 00:07:21,914
I think it's gonna be a long time
before I see Sarah Lynn again.

143
00:07:23,582 --> 00:07:25,584
Who could that be?

144
00:07:27,503 --> 00:07:30,047
Look, BoJack, I appreciate
what you were trying to do,

145
00:07:30,131 --> 00:07:33,843
but I don't need rehab.
Look, good as new, huh?

146
00:07:33,926 --> 00:07:36,428
Oh, great, well, that's a relief.

147
00:07:36,512 --> 00:07:38,430
Uh, should you be taking all those pills?

148
00:07:38,514 --> 00:07:40,057
It's dexitriathylphenolbarbatol.

149
00:07:40,141 --> 00:07:43,268
- I got it from a doctor.
- Your doctor or just a doctor?

150
00:07:43,352 --> 00:07:45,270
I don't know, some doctor, okay?

151
00:07:45,354 --> 00:07:47,523
I met him at Adam Levine's Halloween party.

152
00:07:47,606 --> 00:07:50,860
- I think he said his name was Dr. Who.
- Yeah, I don't think that was...

153
00:07:52,236 --> 00:07:53,737
Ohh, God damn.

154
00:07:53,863 --> 00:07:56,281
Uh, are you supposed to
be snorting it like that?

155
00:07:56,365 --> 00:07:58,993
Ugh! What are you, the
paramedic who restarted

156
00:07:58,994 --> 00:08:01,286
my heart at Adam
Levine's Halloween party?

157
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,497
Okay, so before we put to bed the whole

158
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,000
- you going to rehab thing...
- BoJack, all my life,

159
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,711
I've never been forced to
confront my problems head on.

160
00:08:08,794 --> 00:08:13,423
No one has ever said "no"
to me, ever, so is it cool

161
00:08:13,507 --> 00:08:15,551
if instead of confronting
my problems head on,

162
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:18,054
I just hide out here for a little bit?

163
00:08:18,137 --> 00:08:19,388
Sarah Lynn, I hear what you're saying,

164
00:08:19,471 --> 00:08:20,973
and I think I know what you need.

165
00:08:21,057 --> 00:08:24,608
You just need a strong,
responsible adult to say:

166
00:08:24,643 --> 00:08:27,298
"Yes. Yes, you can move in with me."

167
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,190
This is gonna be fun.
Hey, everyone,

168
00:08:29,273 --> 00:08:30,816
the old gang's getting back together.

169
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,070
<i>♪ Three little orphans ♪
♪ One, two, three ♪</i>

170
00:08:34,153 --> 00:08:37,823
<i>Who-o-o wants
chocolate chip pancakes?</i>

171
00:08:37,907 --> 00:08:41,160
- I do! I do!
- Uh, what's going on in here?

172
00:08:41,244 --> 00:08:43,954
Morning, sleepy-pooh, you want pancakes?

173
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:45,831
Yeah, that sounds great.

174
00:08:45,915 --> 00:08:47,708
Ooh, tough break, champ.
I just gave the last one

175
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,044
to Sarah Lynn.
Early bird gets the worm.

176
00:08:50,127 --> 00:08:52,671
More like early turd gets the sperm.

177
00:08:52,755 --> 00:08:56,092
Wha... "Early turd gets the
sperm," nice one, Sarah Lynn.

178
00:08:56,175 --> 00:08:57,885
You should do a Shouts and Murmurs.

179
00:08:57,968 --> 00:08:59,511
Help yourself to some
cold wheat bran, sport.

180
00:08:59,595 --> 00:09:01,264
Ugh.

181
00:09:01,346 --> 00:09:02,806
Thanks for letting me crash here, BoJack.

182
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,850
The guest room is yours
as long as you want.

183
00:09:04,934 --> 00:09:06,518
You have a guest room?

184
00:09:06,602 --> 00:09:09,272
Why have I been sleeping
on the couch for five years?

185
00:09:09,354 --> 00:09:11,190
You'll get the guest room when
you've earned the guest room.

186
00:09:11,274 --> 00:09:13,734
These pancakes are so good.

187
00:09:13,817 --> 00:09:17,113
All Andrew ever wanted
to eat was stupid lasagna.

188
00:09:17,238 --> 00:09:21,366
- Andrew Garfield loves lasagna?
- I don't want to talk about him!

189
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,744
BoJack, can you drive me to the mall today?

190
00:09:23,827 --> 00:09:26,997
I really want to go shopping,
but I'm not allowed to drive

191
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:30,000
because somebody got a DUI.

192
00:09:30,084 --> 00:09:33,129
Uh, that somebody was you, right?

193
00:09:33,212 --> 00:09:36,081
I don't have to answer your
questions! What are you, the

194
00:09:36,082 --> 00:09:39,051
cop that pulled me over after
Adam Levine's Halloween party?

195
00:09:39,135 --> 00:09:42,346
Honey, do you really think
going to the mall's a good idea?

196
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:44,223
I seem to recall another
time you went shopping

197
00:09:44,307 --> 00:09:47,392
when things got pretty out of control.

198
00:09:47,476 --> 00:09:51,188
Oh, that's too much, man!

199
00:09:53,107 --> 00:09:55,901
Oh. Really?
Not the time when she gored herself

200
00:09:55,985 --> 00:09:58,070
with a bayonet and shat on a floor model?

201
00:09:58,154 --> 00:09:59,655
Hey, I'm not the crazy one.

202
00:09:59,738 --> 00:10:01,573
Andrew's the one who flies off the handle

203
00:10:01,657 --> 00:10:04,368
whenever his agent sets
up an audition on a Monday.

204
00:10:04,451 --> 00:10:08,872
Andrew Garfield hates
Mondays and loves lasagna?

205
00:10:08,956 --> 00:10:10,249
I said I don't want to talk about it!

206
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,708
- She said drop it, Todd!
- Whatever,

207
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:13,460
I don't want to go to the stupid mall.

208
00:10:13,543 --> 00:10:15,045
I'll just tell my friends to come here.

209
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:17,006
Muffin, I've got to work on my book today,

210
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:20,509
and I can't have a bunch of folks over
making a lot of noise.

211
00:10:20,592 --> 00:10:23,762
Oh, I see. I'm a burden to you.

212
00:10:23,846 --> 00:10:26,265
No, no, no, no, no.
Sweetheart. Sweetheart.

213
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:30,019
I'm no longer cute, so I have
nothing to offer this world.

214
00:10:30,102 --> 00:10:32,646
Honey, of course your friends
are always welcome here.

215
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:34,690
Cool. Bye.

216
00:10:34,773 --> 00:10:36,650
- Can I invite a frien...
- No.

217
00:10:38,252 --> 00:10:40,337
You let that basket case into your house?

218
00:10:40,462 --> 00:10:43,049
That girl is a PR hurricane
that you don't need right now.

219
00:10:43,132 --> 00:10:46,260
She has nowhere else to turn.
She broke up with her boyfriend.

220
00:10:46,343 --> 00:10:48,721
She stabbed herself and closed
the wound with duct tape.

221
00:10:48,804 --> 00:10:49,972
- She fired her agent.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

222
00:10:50,056 --> 00:10:51,557
Back it up, horsey.

223
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,350
Did you say Sarah Lynn
doesn't have an agent?

224
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:55,561
Laura, hold my calls, cancel everything!

225
00:10:55,644 --> 00:10:57,950
Ahab's got a white whale to catch, baby!

226
00:11:00,357 --> 00:11:03,925
Uh, hello? Still there?

227
00:11:09,575 --> 00:11:11,785
Oh, th... that's...
that's fragile.

228
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:13,162
Uh, no, oh, no, wait.

229
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:14,413
Careful. Careful. Careful.

230
00:11:14,496 --> 00:11:16,290
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey!

231
00:11:16,373 --> 00:11:19,085
Ah! Lemur!

232
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,268
Great party, Sarah Lynn.

233
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,395
Hi, what it is, banana bread?

234
00:11:38,478 --> 00:11:40,355
I'm not looking for a new agent right now.

235
00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:43,567
Oh, whoa, whoa. Who says
I'm looking for a new client?

236
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,527
Slow your roll, Speed Racer.

237
00:11:45,611 --> 00:11:48,822
We're just two single ladies
having a no-presh rap sesh.

238
00:11:48,906 --> 00:11:51,450
I'm not one of those agents
who can't turn it off.

239
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:54,620
Your Ari Emanuels and Vanessa
Geckos and what have you.

240
00:11:54,703 --> 00:11:58,207
Vanessa Gecko is actually Andrew's
agent, and she's really great.

241
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:01,418
Is she?
I've heard that.

242
00:12:03,712 --> 00:12:06,799
I didn't realize you
were so into house music.

243
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:09,885
Look, I asked her to turn
it down, but apparently,

244
00:12:09,886 --> 00:12:11,887
this volume was prescribed by Dr. Who

245
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:15,308
to treat something called
"uptight dickhead disease."

246
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,810
What do you... What do
you think about Sarah Lynn?

247
00:12:17,893 --> 00:12:20,229
Oh, I don't really think
about her all that much.

248
00:12:20,313 --> 00:12:22,648
I mean, obviously, I'm
a fan of her early work

249
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:25,252
which both satirized and
celebrated youth culture's

250
00:12:25,253 --> 00:12:28,112
obsession with sex, but I do
wonder as a third-wave feminist

251
00:12:28,195 --> 00:12:30,864
if it's even possible for
women to reclaim their sexuality

252
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:32,908
in this deeply entrenched
patriarchal society,

253
00:12:32,992 --> 00:12:35,869
or if claiming to do so is
just a lie we tell ourselves

254
00:12:35,953 --> 00:12:37,830
so we can more comfortably
cater to the male gaze.

255
00:12:37,913 --> 00:12:39,665
- Uh, what?
- But you know,

256
00:12:39,748 --> 00:12:42,417
on the other hand, I worry
that conversations like this one

257
00:12:42,501 --> 00:12:44,544
often dismiss her as a mere
puppet of the industry...

258
00:12:44,628 --> 00:12:46,380
- That's my same worry.
- ... incapable of engaging

259
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,715
- in these discussions herself...
- Obviously.

260
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:51,093
... and infantilization,
which is itself a product

261
00:12:51,177 --> 00:12:52,427
- of the deeply misogynistic...
- So deep.

262
00:12:52,511 --> 00:12:54,513
... society we live in.
But like I said,

263
00:12:54,596 --> 00:12:56,307
I don't really think
about her all that much.

264
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,684
Okay, well, that is very interesting,

265
00:12:58,767 --> 00:13:00,144
but I was more asking,

266
00:13:00,227 --> 00:13:01,895
like, what do you think
about her living here?

267
00:13:01,979 --> 00:13:06,150
Oh, right.
Well, what was your relationship like

268
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:08,027
with her when you were working on the show?

269
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,945
It was very good, very professional.

270
00:13:10,229 --> 00:13:13,366
BoJack, where did you go to college?

271
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:15,951
- Don't bother him, honey.
- Oh, it's no problem.

272
00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:19,163
Honey, college is for ugly
people who can't tap dance.

273
00:13:19,246 --> 00:13:22,457
- I want to be an architect.
- Sweetheart,

274
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,444
Mommy didn't do what Mommy
did to that Star Search

275
00:13:25,445 --> 00:13:27,380
producer so that you
could be an architect.

276
00:13:27,462 --> 00:13:28,881
- Aw.
- All right,

277
00:13:28,964 --> 00:13:31,175
- take it sleazy, everybody.
- Wait, BoJack,

278
00:13:31,258 --> 00:13:33,802
um, what are you doing this weekend?

279
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:36,368
I don't know. I'll probably
just go to the amusement park,

280
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:38,849
maybe the circus, fly a kite
on the beach, watch the sunset,

281
00:13:38,932 --> 00:13:40,393
then I'll head back to my place

282
00:13:40,475 --> 00:13:42,019
to watch any number of
Disney princess movies

283
00:13:42,102 --> 00:13:44,063
while eating ice cream
straight from the tub.

284
00:13:44,146 --> 00:13:47,316
Whoa, that sounds like so much fun.
Can I come?

285
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,818
Yeah, like I
want to spend my weekend

286
00:13:49,902 --> 00:13:53,280
hanging out with a little girl.
Good one!

287
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:55,199
You should write for
the Shouts and Murmurs.

288
00:13:55,282 --> 00:13:56,450
See you Monday!

289
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:58,551
So the makeup they
were putting on you was

290
00:13:58,552 --> 00:14:00,662
not for the show, it
was just for the weekend?

291
00:14:00,746 --> 00:14:03,916
- Why does that matter?
- I'm just trying to understand the story.

292
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:05,959
Do you think it's possible
that you inviting Sarah Lynn

293
00:14:06,043 --> 00:14:08,712
into your house now is your
way of compensating for not...

294
00:14:08,837 --> 00:14:10,881
No, Diane, I'm just helping out a friend.

295
00:14:10,964 --> 00:14:13,592
I'm not trying to play out
some weird, sick dad fantasy,

296
00:14:13,675 --> 00:14:16,262
or resolve a deep guilt for past neglect,

297
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:18,972
or even try to retroactively
fix my own childhood

298
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:21,016
by recreating someone else's,

299
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,311
and I'm especially not doing
all those things at once!

300
00:14:24,395 --> 00:14:25,562
Okay.

301
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:27,356
What happened?

302
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,524
Did somebody hurt my precious baby?

303
00:14:29,608 --> 00:14:32,069
Sarah Lynn! Ah! What the... ?

304
00:14:32,152 --> 00:14:33,820
Oh, hey, BoJack.

305
00:14:33,904 --> 00:14:35,614
I told my friends they could
tear this wall out to build

306
00:14:35,697 --> 00:14:37,783
a sweet cocaine booth/sex closet.

307
00:14:37,866 --> 00:14:39,952
- Is that cool?
- No, that's not cool.

308
00:14:40,035 --> 00:14:42,037
Oof. Way to harsh the vibe, Kissinger.

309
00:14:42,121 --> 00:14:44,957
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize.

310
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,460
I thought this was a place where Sarah Lynn

311
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:51,338
could finally be Sarah Lynn, but I guess...

312
00:14:51,464 --> 00:14:56,218
- that's too much, man.
- I always loved that catch phrase.

313
00:14:56,302 --> 00:14:58,762
Can your friends at least take
the artwork off the wall first?

314
00:14:58,845 --> 00:15:02,808
Ooh. I want to say yes, but no.

315
00:15:02,891 --> 00:15:06,937
- Okay, good talk.
- Wha... Are you serious?

316
00:15:10,732 --> 00:15:13,902
The reason I have called
this house meeting is...

317
00:15:13,986 --> 00:15:15,904
Todd, how many times
have we been over this?

318
00:15:15,988 --> 00:15:18,407
You don't have the authority
to call house meetings.

319
00:15:18,491 --> 00:15:20,305
Only I can call a house meeting.

320
00:15:20,306 --> 00:15:22,119
You can propose a house meeting.

321
00:15:22,202 --> 00:15:24,121
All right, fine, fine, fine,
but the reason I propose

322
00:15:24,204 --> 00:15:25,705
- this house meeting...
- Your proposal has been

323
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:27,958
submitted and is under board review.

324
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,419
- Proposal denied.
- BoJack, this Sarah Lynn thing

325
00:15:30,503 --> 00:15:33,839
is getting out of control, okay?
She's taking advantage of you.

326
00:15:33,922 --> 00:15:36,550
What? No she's not. We
have a special relationship.

327
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:38,302
You couldn't possibly understand.

328
00:15:38,385 --> 00:15:40,554
Oh, my God. Look at what
she's done to your house.

329
00:15:40,637 --> 00:15:42,639
All right, look, I mean, I
stepped on a needle earlier.

330
00:15:42,722 --> 00:15:44,224
I think I'm addicted to heroin now,

331
00:15:44,308 --> 00:15:46,685
so now, that's probably
gonna be a whole thing.

332
00:15:46,768 --> 00:15:48,603
I have to say, I agree with Todd.

333
00:15:48,687 --> 00:15:50,230
You're not this girl's father,
and you're not doing her

334
00:15:50,314 --> 00:15:52,483
any favors by refusing to set boundaries.

335
00:15:52,566 --> 00:15:54,860
Look, I played a dad for nine years on TV,

336
00:15:54,943 --> 00:15:56,862
so I think I know a little
bit more about parenting

337
00:15:56,945 --> 00:15:59,031
than you two jokers.
The kids on Horsin' Around

338
00:15:59,114 --> 00:16:00,657
didn't need boundaries.

339
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,118
All they needed was some
good, old-fashioned love.

340
00:16:03,202 --> 00:16:05,704
BoJack!
This is not a TV show, okay?

341
00:16:05,787 --> 00:16:07,622
This is real life.

342
00:16:07,706 --> 00:16:10,876
Ah! Lemur on fire! Lemur on fire!

343
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:16,840
Some good, old-fashioned love,
and I'm gonna give it to her.

344
00:16:16,923 --> 00:16:21,387
I'm gonna give it to her so... hard.

345
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,763
You know, I feel like
we don't ever hang out.

346
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,518
Here you are, milady,

347
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:30,645
a gin and nutmeg just like you asked.

348
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:32,606
Ugh. Too much nutmeg.

349
00:16:32,689 --> 00:16:34,900
Well, you know what
would taste even better?

350
00:16:34,983 --> 00:16:37,486
An endorsement for a Slovakian yogurt.

351
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,613
Could Vanessa Gecko get you that?

352
00:16:39,696 --> 00:16:43,576
Vanessa Gecko got Andrew
The Social Network,

353
00:16:43,658 --> 00:16:46,036
and she has skybox seats
at the Staples Center.

354
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:47,704
- What do you have?
- Well, I've got a table

355
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:49,415
at the Comedy Central
roast of Gloria Stein...

356
00:16:49,498 --> 00:16:51,584
Hey, Sarah Lynn, what say
we spend the day together,

357
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,127
just you and me, away from all the haters?

358
00:16:54,211 --> 00:16:57,548
- I want to say yes, but...
- Great, let's go.

Yeah, in the butt. He's got,
like, six months I think.

369
00:17:28,036 --> 00:17:30,330
Well, that's horrible. Why
would you tell me that now?

370
00:17:30,414 --> 00:17:32,874
I don't know. The sun
setting over those two hills

371
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,751
made me think of a big
ass, and that made me think

372
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:36,503
of ass cancer, and that made me think

373
00:17:36,587 --> 00:17:39,756
of Herb Kazaz's ass cancer.
You really didn't know?

No, Herb and I aren't on the best...

ever had kids of my own,

I'd give it to them one day.

Did you get rid of your old TV Guide award?

393
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,602
This pawnshop on La Cienega was selling one

- with your name on it.
- What?

Wait, why were you at a pawnshop?

I can't believe you pawned my award.

408
00:19:01,547 --> 00:19:04,383
It wasn't personal. I just
thought your award was stupid,

409
00:19:04,466 --> 00:19:06,218
and I already have a billion other awards,

410
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:08,011
and I wanted to get money for drugs.

Oh, you know
what I'm going through? Why?

414
00:19:16,061 --> 00:19:18,772
Because you were on some dumb
kids show a million years ago?

415
00:19:18,855 --> 00:19:20,982
- Hey, now.
- I had my own fashion line

416
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:24,444
when I was ten. By 20,
I was packing stadiums.

417
00:19:24,528 --> 00:19:27,406
I get letters every
day from boys telling me

418
00:19:27,489 --> 00:19:29,824
that I was the first
girl they masturbated to.

419
00:19:29,908 --> 00:19:32,786
Literally, someone tells me that every day.

420
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:35,748
- That is gross.
- Oh-ho, I know!

421
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,957
You sit up here in your little house

422
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:41,086
and feel sorry for yourself?
Oh, guess what, Bo-J,

423
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:43,171
in order to be a has-been,
you have to have actually,

424
00:19:43,255 --> 00:19:45,965
- you know, been.
- You are way out of line!

425
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:48,343
You're not my dad. You're
just a rugged, older man

426
00:19:48,427 --> 00:19:50,512
who provided me with a
strong, masculine presence

427
00:19:50,596 --> 00:19:52,097
during my formative years.

428
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,015
I'm not your dad, and you're not my child.

429
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:56,685
We're just a man and a lady
living in a house together,

430
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:59,187
and we're both adults, and
we're both a little drunk.

- I'm a bad "widdle" girl.

433
00:20:14,035 --> 00:20:16,204
Yeah, you are bad, very bad!

434
00:20:16,288 --> 00:20:20,459
You want me to put it out
with my boob?

435
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:22,294
- Uh, what?
- Your boob

436
00:20:22,377 --> 00:20:26,423
is a very impractical
way to put out a fire.

437
00:20:26,506 --> 00:20:27,800
What is happening?

438
00:20:27,882 --> 00:20:29,926
I think you have a serious drug problem.

439
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:33,221
The only drug I need is horse.

440

Please don't do this.

No, no. Why are you...

443
00:20:38,518 --> 00:20:40,312
This is a very bad idea.

444
00:20:40,395 --> 00:20:42,021

445
00:20:42,105 --> 00:20:43,607

Oh, my God, my arm.

447
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,985
- You got my arm.
- Ow! Ow!

448
00:20:47,068 --> 00:20:49,404
I'm in it now. Oh, God,
no! I'm a part of it.

449
00:20:53,617 --> 00:20:56,161
I still haven't regained
the feeling in my fingers.

450
00:20:56,244 --> 00:20:58,163
That was the longest
two minutes of my life.

451
00:20:58,246 --> 00:21:00,874
Um, I think it was a little
longer than two minutes.

452
00:21:00,957 --> 00:21:02,459
It was longer than two minutes.

453
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:05,504

454

Oh, you mean from a P.R. standpoint?

455

Yeah, 'cause if this got
out, oh, I would get flayed!

Oh, I'm done being the voice of reason.

457
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:17,098
It's exhausting. I got
to take an angry nap.

458
00:21:17,182 --> 00:21:19,518
Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.

459
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:21,978
I know. I know. She's
taking advantage of me.

460
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:23,730
Actually, it kind of
feels like you're the one

461
00:21:23,814 --> 00:21:25,440
taking advantage of her.
She's the one

462
00:21:25,524 --> 00:21:27,942
with substance abuse
problems and daddy issues.

463
00:21:28,026 --> 00:21:29,736
Hey, we both have substance abuse problems

464
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,905
- and daddy issues.
- Yeah, but she came

465
00:21:31,988 --> 00:21:34,949
to you for help.

466
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:37,952
Hey, notice how I've been ignoring you,

467
00:21:38,036 --> 00:21:40,413
playing hard to get?
Only makes you want me more.

468
00:21:40,497 --> 00:21:42,123
Ugh. Go stand on the
other side of the room.

469
00:21:42,207 --> 00:21:44,125
- Okay.
- Sarah Lynn, get your coat.

470
00:21:44,209 --> 00:21:46,336
- I'm taking you to rehab.
- Nah,

471
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:48,588
I was gonna keep hanging
out here if that's all right.

472
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,757
- No, it's not all right.
- What?

473
00:21:50,841 --> 00:21:52,592
This place isn't good for you.

474
00:21:52,676 --> 00:21:55,470
You need to go where you
can get help, real help.

475
00:21:55,554 --> 00:21:57,723
But I thought you were
always gonna be there for me

476
00:21:57,806 --> 00:21:58,973
like you said.

477
00:21:59,057 --> 00:22:01,685
I will always be there for you.

478
00:22:01,768 --> 00:22:03,395
<i>Cut, let's take ten.</i>

479
00:22:03,478 --> 00:22:06,314
That's ten, everyone.
Let's make it a tight ten.

480
00:22:06,398 --> 00:22:07,566
These pages are shit.

481
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:09,150
you understand? Shit.

482
00:22:09,234 --> 00:22:10,819
I wouldn't wipe my ass with these pages.

483
00:22:10,903 --> 00:22:12,571
It would defeat the whole
purpose of wiping my ass.

484
00:22:12,654 --> 00:22:14,406
- Phone for you.
- Uh-huh.

485
00:22:14,489 --> 00:22:16,032
You get me points on the back end?

486
00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:18,785
Well, I told you I'm not
gonna do it unless I get points.

487
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:20,370
Oh, they can't find any?

488
00:22:20,453 --> 00:22:21,663
Well, maybe they could
suck some out of my dick!

489
00:22:21,747 --> 00:22:23,039
I'm on the phone.

490
00:22:23,122 --> 00:22:26,000
You're being very rude.

491
00:22:26,084 --> 00:22:28,211
You promised me you would always be there.

492
00:22:28,294 --> 00:22:30,630
Sarah Lynn, this is for your own good.

493
00:22:30,714 --> 00:22:32,298
You can't stay here anymore.

494
00:22:32,382 --> 00:22:35,027
Okie-doke. I guess I'll
just move out and find one of

495
00:22:35,028 --> 00:22:37,721
the billion people who will
let me party at their house.

496
00:22:37,804 --> 00:22:40,557
Uh, well, you should not do that.

497
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,268
Oh, I know.
I know, but I can, so I will.

498
00:22:43,351 --> 00:22:45,186
I'm at a place right now where I never need

499
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:48,106
to grow as a person or rise to an occasion

500
00:22:48,189 --> 00:22:50,692
because I can constantly
just surround myself

501
00:22:50,776 --> 00:22:53,278
with sycophants and enablers
until I die tragically young.

502
00:22:53,361 --> 00:22:58,241
- Wh-What?
- Yeah, it's pretty much too late for me.

503
00:22:58,324 --> 00:23:01,160
Well, them's the breaks.
Take it sleazy, everybody.

504
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:03,914
Oh, by the way, I called Vanessa Gecko,

505
00:23:03,997 --> 00:23:05,582
and I'm meeting with her tomorrow.

506
00:23:05,665 --> 00:23:08,293
- Thanks for the suggestion.
- No! No, no, no, no, no!

507
00:23:08,376 --> 00:23:11,504
Hey, you guys want to
hear my new catchphrase?

508
00:23:11,588 --> 00:23:15,300
Suck a dick, dumb shits!

509
00:23:17,427 --> 00:23:20,179
Laura, the dummy took the
bait. Now for phase two.

510
00:23:20,263 --> 00:23:23,976
Is she gone?
Is it safe to come out?

511
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:26,060
Leak to the trades that
Andrew Garfield's agent

512
00:23:26,144 --> 00:23:29,063
is taking meetings with his
ex, get it all over town,

513
00:23:29,147 --> 00:23:30,983
wait an hour, then get me lunch with Andrew

514
00:23:31,065 --> 00:23:34,694
on the books for this
weekend, someplace Italian.

515
00:23:34,778 --> 00:23:36,446
I really blew it, didn't I?

516
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:38,907
I mean, maybe you could
have been a better role model

517
00:23:38,991 --> 00:23:41,910
when she was young, but also,
she never really had a chance.

518
00:23:41,994 --> 00:23:44,037
This is what our celebrity
culture does to people.

519
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,808
So what you're saying is:

520
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:48,768
Everything is society's
fault, and we as individuals

521
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:51,336
never need to take
responsibility for anything?

522
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:54,006
Uh, no. Not exactly.
I was just saying that...

523
00:23:54,088 --> 00:23:56,591
Yeah. I like that.
I didn't do anything wrong

524
00:23:56,675 --> 00:23:58,259
because I can't do anything wrong

525
00:23:58,343 --> 00:24:00,053
because we're all just
products of our environment,

526
00:24:00,136 --> 00:24:01,346
bouncing around like marbles

527
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:02,806
in the game of Hungry Hungry Hippos

528
00:24:02,889 --> 00:24:04,516
that is our random and cruel universe.

529
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:06,225
Wait, no, that's not
even what I'm saying...

530
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:08,854
Yeah, It's not my fault. It's society.

531
00:24:08,937 --> 00:24:11,439
Everything is because of society!

532
00:24:11,523 --> 00:24:13,733
- BoJack, that...
- Dude, just let him have this.

533
00:24:13,817 --> 00:24:16,152
Hooray! Everything is meaningless!

534
00:24:16,235 --> 00:24:18,989
<i>Nothing I do has consequence!</i>

535
00:24:21,324 --> 00:24:25,453
- So what'd you get, anything good?
- Oh, I got everything.
