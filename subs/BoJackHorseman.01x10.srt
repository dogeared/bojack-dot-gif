1
00:00:04,086 --> 00:00:06,004
We're very different, but
I think that we bring out

2
00:00:06,088 --> 00:00:07,965
the best in each other.

3
00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:11,302
It's like you're chocolate
and I'm Mr. Peanutbutter.

4
00:00:11,385 --> 00:00:14,554
Shut up and kiss me, you silly goof.

5
00:00:17,057 --> 00:00:20,727
Cut!

6
00:00:20,811 --> 00:00:23,147
Welcome back to Excess Hollywoo.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,066
I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type,
and I'm visiting the set

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,319
of Mr. Peanutbutter's Hollywoo Heist.

9
00:00:28,402 --> 00:00:30,946
I'm thrilled to be talking
to the star of the film,

10
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:33,949
BoJack Horseman, and his
real life inspiration,

11
00:00:34,032 --> 00:00:35,159
Mr. Peanutbutter.

12
00:00:35,242 --> 00:00:36,868
Am I an inspiration?

13
00:00:36,952 --> 00:00:38,496
Well, that depends on how you define...

14
00:00:38,578 --> 00:00:40,872
- Wait a minute. Yes, I am.
- Ugh.

15
00:00:40,956 --> 00:00:43,041
You know, I'm just over
the moon to be producing

16
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,544
this movie about my daring exploit.

17
00:00:45,627 --> 00:00:48,547
- Yes, your daring exploit.
- Yes.

18
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,342
It's such a treat to be
shooting in my very own casa.

19
00:00:51,425 --> 00:00:55,220
And it's an even sweeter treat
to be played by my good amigo...

20
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:56,805
dare I say best amigo?

21
00:00:56,888 --> 00:00:58,682
- You "daren't."
- We're so in tune.

22
00:00:58,765 --> 00:01:03,521
We even finish each other's...

23
00:01:03,603 --> 00:01:05,439
sentences.

24
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:06,815
Sometimes it doesn't happen.

25
00:01:06,898 --> 00:01:07,983
- It never...
- Happens.

26
00:01:08,066 --> 00:01:10,610
Ah, see? I'm inside him.

27
00:01:10,694 --> 00:01:12,863
BoJack, you haven't
worked in quite some time.

28
00:01:12,946 --> 00:01:14,739
In fact, I thought you were dead.

29
00:01:14,823 --> 00:01:17,868
You must be so grateful to be
working again and also alive,

30
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:19,911
which, again, I thought you were not.

31
00:01:19,995 --> 00:01:21,330
How did you get involved with this?

32
00:01:21,413 --> 00:01:22,581
Well...

33
00:01:22,664 --> 00:01:23,748
You want me to play Mr. Peanutbutter

34
00:01:23,832 --> 00:01:26,544
in the story he stole from me?

35
00:01:26,626 --> 00:01:27,919
I stole the D,

36
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:29,880
and then he stole my stealing of it.

37
00:01:29,963 --> 00:01:32,383
That makes him an idea
thief, which is much less cool

38
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:34,385
than a thief thief, which is what I am

39
00:01:34,468 --> 00:01:35,469
and what he also is.

40
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,928
You know what might help?

41
00:01:37,012 --> 00:01:38,389
If you think about this like a professional

42
00:01:38,472 --> 00:01:40,015
instead of a big titty baby.

43
00:01:40,098 --> 00:01:42,184
This movie is a huge opportunity.

44
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:45,687
Quentin Tarantulino is known
for revitalizing dead careers.

45
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,689
This could do for you what Reservoir Dogs

46
00:01:47,772 --> 00:01:49,024
did for Rin Tin Tin.

47
00:01:49,107 --> 00:01:50,650
But isn't there any other part?

48
00:01:50,734 --> 00:01:52,403
I could play myself.

49
00:01:52,486 --> 00:01:54,572
No, BoJack's already being
played by Wallace Shawn.

50
00:01:54,654 --> 00:01:56,198
What? The short guy from The Princess Bride

51
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:57,533
who says "inconceivable"?

52
00:01:57,616 --> 00:01:59,868
- Why Wallace Shawn?
- BoJack Horseman?

53
00:01:59,951 --> 00:02:01,245
I don't want to play that boob.

54
00:02:01,328 --> 00:02:02,871
I'm trying to help you out, Wally.

55
00:02:02,954 --> 00:02:05,499
You're the one who keeps
buying expensive Rothkos.

56
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,251
I have a disease.

57
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:10,629
Would you tell an alcoholic
to stop buying alcohol?

58
00:02:10,754 --> 00:02:12,756
You know, Black and Blue Number 7's

59
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:14,299
going up for auction next week.

60
00:02:14,383 --> 00:02:15,842
Fine. I'll do the dumb movie.

61
00:02:15,926 --> 00:02:17,636
Fine. I'll do the dumb movie.

62
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,888
But if you find me in a bathtub
with open wrists tomorrow

63
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:22,349
and the words "I hate my
agent" smeared across the walls

64
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:24,101
in blood, you'll know why.

65
00:02:24,184 --> 00:02:27,729
So obviously I'm thrilled
to be here, just thrilled.

66
00:03:17,272 --> 00:03:18,672

- www.addic7ed.com -

67
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:24,286
Cast and crew only.

68
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:26,246
I know you're just doing your job,

69
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,791
but I live here, and the crew
has been here since 3:00 a.m.,

70
00:03:29,874 --> 00:03:31,335
so I'm a little tired.

71
00:03:31,418 --> 00:03:33,420
Cast and crew only.

72
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,921
Hey, stranger.

73
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:36,465
Haven't really seen you since the wedding.

74
00:03:36,548 --> 00:03:38,342
Kind of feels like we're
coming back to school

75
00:03:38,425 --> 00:03:39,759
- after summer vacation.
- Yeah.

76
00:03:39,843 --> 00:03:41,428
I'll see you at the pep rally.

77
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,347
Hope we don't get Mrs.
Kirkman for trig this year.

78
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,724
Yeah, well, I hope the
cheerleaders don't stuff me

79
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:48,059
in a locker and write
"virgin slut" on my forehead,

80
00:03:48,143 --> 00:03:49,853
and then when I ask how
I could be both a virgin

81
00:03:49,936 --> 00:03:51,730
and a slut, they make me eat a lipstick.

82
00:03:51,813 --> 00:03:53,482
Uh...

83
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:55,775
So what have you been up
to these last couple months?

84
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:58,778
Well, I've been pretty busy.
Met a girl at Soho House.

85
00:03:58,862 --> 00:04:00,405
- Was she your waitress?
- Yes.

86
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:01,948
Then I met a girl at Mastro's.

87
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:03,534
- Was she also your waitress?
- Yes.

88
00:04:03,617 --> 00:04:04,826
Then I met a girl at P.F. Chang's.

89
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:06,370
Let me guess. She was your...

90
00:04:06,453 --> 00:04:08,372
A hooker, yes, but what
she really wants to do

91
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:10,123
is wait tables.

92
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:12,167
Well, I, for one, would love to meet

93
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,544
the aspiring food-service worker

94
00:04:13,627 --> 00:04:15,379
who finally gets you to settle down.

95
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:17,464
What? Why would I want to settle down?

96
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,799
I'm 50.

97
00:04:19,883 --> 00:04:22,260
- Yeah, anyway...
- So I'm sending the first draft

98
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:23,803
of the book to Pinky this afternoon.

99
00:04:23,887 --> 00:04:26,390
- What? It's done?
- Not yet. Almost.

100
00:04:26,473 --> 00:04:29,059
I'm excited for you to read it,

101
00:04:29,142 --> 00:04:31,061
but I'm also cripplingly nervous.

102
00:04:31,144 --> 00:04:33,021
I actually kind of feel like throwing up,

103
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:34,814
but I can't throw up because
I haven't had anything to eat

104
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:36,983
because this lady won't
let me in my own kitchen.

105
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:38,694
Cast and crew only.

106
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:40,738
Listen, if reading a book
you wrote is anywhere near

107
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,947
as great as it is to
actually spend time with you,

108
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:45,075
I'm sure it's gonna be wonderful.

109
00:04:45,158 --> 00:04:47,202
Having said that, what
do I know about books?

110
00:04:47,285 --> 00:04:49,204
I'm just a dumb actor.

111
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:54,459
I'm here with Hollywoo darling Naomi Watts.

112
00:04:54,543 --> 00:04:56,878
Tell me, what attracted
you to the role of Diane?

113
00:04:56,961 --> 00:04:58,630
I just keep getting pigeonholed

114
00:04:58,714 --> 00:05:01,174
as these complex characters
in highly acclaimed movies.

115
00:05:01,258 --> 00:05:03,260
For once, I would just love to phone it in

116
00:05:03,343 --> 00:05:05,303
and play a two-dimensional
girl in a rom com

117
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:07,097
with no inner life of her own.

118
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,516
That's kind of the reason
I got into this business.

119
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,476
Ha ha! You said words.

120
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,021
Now, is it true you stay
in character between takes?

121
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:17,733
Oh, we all do. The
director insists upon it.

122
00:05:17,816 --> 00:05:20,444
He even has everyone calling me Diane

123
00:05:20,527 --> 00:05:22,404
to help me get in the headspace.

124
00:05:22,487 --> 00:05:24,030
It's been great.

125
00:05:24,114 --> 00:05:25,156
Diane, looking good.

126
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,117
- Um, thanks.
- Ugh, not you.

127
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,201
I was talking to Diane.

128
00:05:28,285 --> 00:05:29,661
Oh, thank you.

129
00:05:29,745 --> 00:05:30,788
Now, where's my peanut butter?

130
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,247
Right over here, Q.

131
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,373
No, I'm looking for peanut butter.

132
00:05:33,457 --> 00:05:34,874
Oh, you mean BoJack?

133
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,835
If I wanted BoJack, I would call BoJack.

134
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:38,837
Did someone call for BoJack?

135
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,715
It really cuts down on confusion.

136
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:47,345
Ah, show business, the great equalizer.

137
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:49,055
Is that what it is?

138
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:50,682
Todd, spritz me.

139
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:53,143
- Spritzing.
- Mm, mm, mm.

140
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:54,561
Well spritzed.

141
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,354
Have you ever been on a movie set before?

142
00:05:56,438 --> 00:05:58,189
No, sir, Mr. Peanutbutter.

143
00:05:58,273 --> 00:06:01,693
Please, Mr. Peanutbutter
was my father's name.

144
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:03,821
- Uh...
- And it's also my name!

145
00:06:05,196 --> 00:06:06,782
Ooh, speaking of Mr. Peanutbutter,

146
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:08,450
I'll be back in a jiff, skippy.

147
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:10,494
Keep that air spritzed for me.

148
00:06:10,577 --> 00:06:12,162
Aloha, kemosabe.

149
00:06:12,245 --> 00:06:14,706
Hey, allow me to put on my producer hat

150
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,000
and produce you just for one second here.

151
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,461
I have a few notes on
how you're playing me.

152
00:06:19,544 --> 00:06:21,713
Let's see.

153
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,715
Problems, problems,
problems, ah, here we go.

154
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:26,468
I find it really troubling
that my movie self

155
00:06:26,551 --> 00:06:28,970
is wearing a crew neck T-shirt.

156
00:06:29,053 --> 00:06:30,472
I only wear V-necks.

157
00:06:30,555 --> 00:06:32,015
You see the problem.

158
00:06:32,098 --> 00:06:33,684
- I do not.
- I just think if we're telling

159
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:35,853
the story, we should tell
it how it really happened.

160
00:06:35,935 --> 00:06:38,229
Yeah, this whole story
isn't how it really happened.

161
00:06:38,313 --> 00:06:40,106
Right...

162
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,566
because of the shirts.

163
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,234
Because I'm the one who stole the D.

164
00:06:43,318 --> 00:06:44,569
I'm the real hero here.

165
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:46,237
My life is full of exciting adventures.

166
00:06:46,321 --> 00:06:47,322
I should write a book.

167
00:06:47,405 --> 00:06:48,990
Oh, wait. I did.

168
00:06:49,073 --> 00:06:50,617
Suck on that, society.

169
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,160
Hey, you're in a mood.

170
00:06:52,243 --> 00:06:53,871
Perhaps the tightness of that crew neck

171
00:06:53,953 --> 00:06:55,955
is cutting off circulation to the brain?

172
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,666
Let me talk to Donna in wardrobe.

173
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:59,167
We're gonna fix this, buddy.

174
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,251
Donna!

175
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,089
What are you doing?

176
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:08,259
I'm just trying to get inside
my character, which is you.

177
00:07:08,343 --> 00:07:09,761
Is this how we move our arms?

178
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:11,221
We're so weird.

179
00:07:11,304 --> 00:07:12,514
Is this really necessary?

180
00:07:12,597 --> 00:07:14,140
Is this really necessary?

181
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:15,433
That's not what I sound like.

182
00:07:15,517 --> 00:07:17,268
That's not mut mi sound mike.

183
00:07:17,352 --> 00:07:19,270
Hey, what's it been like
since we got married?

184
00:07:19,354 --> 00:07:21,648
Is it everything we dreamed
of since we were little?

185
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,567
When I was little, I dreamed of getting

186
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,694
a MacArthur grant for my
'zine about how all the girls

187
00:07:25,777 --> 00:07:27,195
at school were bitches.

188
00:07:27,278 --> 00:07:29,656
- Oh.
- Look, the wedding was great.

189
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,700
But that's not real life.

190
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:33,326
I mean, I guess I got a happy ending,

191
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,328
but every happy ending has the day after

192
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:36,580
the happy ending, right?

193
00:07:36,663 --> 00:07:37,789
And the day after that.

194
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:40,124
So the wedding was so much fun.

195
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,626
It was the happiest day of my life.

196
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,211
But, you know, what does that say

197
00:07:43,294 --> 00:07:45,296
about all the days I have left?

198
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,506
Whoa.

199
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,843
We're such a Zoe.

200
00:07:51,386 --> 00:07:52,721
Oh, Todd, glad you're here.

201
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:53,805
Hold this.

202
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:55,682
Todd, my jacket is on the floor.

203
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,058
You're supposed to hold the jacket

204
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:58,643
so it doesn't go on the floor.

205
00:07:58,727 --> 00:08:01,980
Hey, sorry, BoJack... I
mean, uh, Mr. Peanutbutter.

206
00:08:02,063 --> 00:08:04,441
But I work for Mr. Peanutbutter now.

207
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:07,360
- I mean, uh, Mr. Peanutbutter.
- Ugh.

208
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:08,987
I can't believe I'm on
a movie set, you know?

209
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,656
I mean, this is my first
chance to work on something big

210
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,325
since my rock opera fell apart.

211
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:17,788
Man, I really messed up
that huge career opportunity

212
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:18,956
all on my own, didn't I?

213
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:20,081
Uh...

214
00:08:20,164 --> 00:08:25,462
Nothing sabotaged me one bit.

215
00:08:25,545 --> 00:08:26,546
Yep.

216
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,631
You said it.

217
00:08:27,714 --> 00:08:30,174
Well, see you later.

218
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,887
Where can I grab a nosh?

219
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,931
Oh, craft services is in the kitchen.

220
00:08:36,014 --> 00:08:38,016
Up the driveway, through
the living room, make a left.

221
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:40,059
- Can't miss it.
- I'm gonna grab a quick bite.

222
00:08:40,143 --> 00:08:42,562
Don't do anything stupid while I'm gone.

223
00:08:42,646 --> 00:08:44,815
Okay, fellas, here's the
thing about the story.

224
00:08:44,898 --> 00:08:46,190
I don't buy it.

225
00:08:46,274 --> 00:08:47,651
It's like something's missing,

226
00:08:47,734 --> 00:08:49,277
but I can't put any of my fingers on it.

227
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,362
Um, maybe once we add the music...

228
00:08:51,446 --> 00:08:52,572
The music? Are you kidding me?

229
00:08:52,656 --> 00:08:53,865
Music? You're fired.

230
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:55,116
What dumb shit brought this dumb shit?

231
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:56,200
Okay, you're fired too.

232
00:08:56,284 --> 00:08:57,577
Oh, okay.

233
00:08:57,661 --> 00:09:00,204
Anyone else got any bright ideas?

234
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:01,581
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

235
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:04,501
Hey, maybe it make it more Diane-y?

236
00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:06,544
- Um, excuse me?
- I don't know.

237
00:09:06,628 --> 00:09:08,755
This is probably stupid,
but the whole story's

238
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,049
about how this guy's in
love with this lady, right?

239
00:09:11,132 --> 00:09:14,427
But we don't even know who
she is or what she wants.

240
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:16,888
I mean, maybe give her more lines or words

241
00:09:16,972 --> 00:09:19,223
or, I don't know, feelings or whatever?

242
00:09:19,307 --> 00:09:20,308
What?

243
00:09:20,391 --> 00:09:22,310
He's new. He doesn't know the rules.

244
00:09:22,393 --> 00:09:24,688
Forgive him, mighty Caesar.

245
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:31,110
Yes. Yeah.

246
00:09:31,194 --> 00:09:32,195
I love you.

247
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:33,279
Who is this kid?

248
00:09:33,363 --> 00:09:34,614
You're a genius.

249
00:09:34,698 --> 00:09:35,782
- I'm gonna kiss your face.
- What?

250
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,784
Oh!

251
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,202
Come back to my web.

252
00:09:39,285 --> 00:09:40,620
Let's talk about Diane's feelings

253
00:09:40,704 --> 00:09:42,080
and make this baby sing.

254
00:09:42,163 --> 00:09:44,582
Hey, Todd, talk to him about the wardrobe,

255
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,584
specifically the top half of the wardrobe,

256
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:49,462
specifically the shirt part of
the top half of the wardrobe,

257
00:09:49,546 --> 00:09:52,716
specifically the neck part of
the shirt part of the wardrobe.

258
00:09:54,843 --> 00:09:56,219
Ugh. What now?

259
00:09:56,302 --> 00:09:58,013
I'm sick of this dog and pony show.

260
00:09:58,096 --> 00:09:59,597
The movie is dumb.

261
00:09:59,681 --> 00:10:01,349
Mr. Peanutbutter is
annoying the shit out of me,

262
00:10:01,432 --> 00:10:02,976
and there's too much
honeydew in the fruit bowl.

263
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,644
Blech. Honeydew is garbage fruit.

264
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:06,855
Also, why is BoJack being
played by an old, nebbishy

265
00:10:06,938 --> 00:10:07,939
five-foot-tall
bald guy?

266
00:10:08,023 --> 00:10:09,357
Is that how the world sees me?

267
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,441
Oh, I see.

268
00:10:10,525 --> 00:10:12,861
So I can play Vanya on 42nd Street,

269
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:15,864
but I'm not a deft-enough
talent to capture the essence

270
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:17,949
of the elusive BoJack Horseman.

271
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:22,037
So sorry to offend you, sir.

272
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,955
I'm just glad my book's coming out soon

273
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,916
so people will get an opportunity to see

274
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:27,458
the real BoJack Horseman.

275
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:29,086
Oh, are you coming out with a book?

276
00:10:29,168 --> 00:10:30,378
You never mentioned it.

277
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:31,629
Plus, Todd's being super weird.

278
00:10:31,713 --> 00:10:32,756
I think he's onto me.

279
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:33,882
Onto you in regards to what?

280
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:35,592
Oh, right, I didn't tell you.

281
00:10:35,675 --> 00:10:38,261
I sabotaged his rock opera
by getting him readdicted

282
00:10:38,344 --> 00:10:40,304
to a video game because I
didn't want him to move out.

283
00:10:40,388 --> 00:10:42,057
Jesus Christ, BoJack.

284
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:44,267
Anyway, I think he knows
and might be plotting

285
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,727
to sabotage me back.

286
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,604
Why is it that 90% of our conversations

287
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:49,814
these days revolve
around plotting sabotages?

288
00:10:49,898 --> 00:10:51,524
Are you saying I should
plot a countersabotage?

289
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:53,401
No, no more plotting.

290
00:10:53,484 --> 00:10:55,695
Just be a good soldier and do your job.

291
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:57,072
Nobody is out to get you.

292
00:10:58,239 --> 00:10:59,824
Have you seen the new draft?

293
00:10:59,908 --> 00:11:01,910
They took it all off you and put it on me.

294
00:11:01,993 --> 00:11:03,286
What?

295
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:05,789
Apparently some dickweed named Todd

296
00:11:05,872 --> 00:11:08,083
decided I should be three-dimensional

297
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,001
and you should have no lines.

298
00:11:10,085 --> 00:11:12,045
Ugh. Isn't this town sick of creating

299
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,338
three-dimensional roles for women?

300
00:11:14,422 --> 00:11:16,174
This happens to me all the time!

301
00:11:16,257 --> 00:11:19,302
A.O. Scott is sick of talking
about how brilliant I am.

302
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:21,471
Todd.

303
00:11:21,554 --> 00:11:23,264
I guess what I've been saying

304
00:11:23,347 --> 00:11:26,267
for the last seven
uninterrupted minutes is,

305
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,271
how can I forgive my father
if I can't forgive myself?

306
00:11:30,354 --> 00:11:31,898
True dat.

307
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:35,234
But none of that matters,
because we bring out

308
00:11:35,318 --> 00:11:36,987
the best in each other.

309
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:41,658
I'm the chocolate, and
you're Mr. Peanutbutter!

310
00:11:41,741 --> 00:11:43,827
- True dat.
- Mwah!

311
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,703
Cut! Amazing.

312
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:47,789
This is the movie that I wanted to make.

313
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:48,873
This is gonna be great.

314
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:50,750
- Oh, my God, I'm so...
- Ugh, what kind of idiot

315
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:53,211
puts food on top of a hill?

316
00:11:53,294 --> 00:11:56,131
Hey, so I guess now that
the movie's all about Diane,

317
00:11:56,214 --> 00:11:59,176
I really need to dig deep
and get to know the real you.

318
00:11:59,258 --> 00:12:02,804
So let's talk and talk
and talk until I am you

319
00:12:02,887 --> 00:12:04,764
and you are nothing
but a hollowed-out husk

320
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:07,391
of your former self and every
thought and every feeling

321
00:12:07,475 --> 00:12:11,270
you ever had belongs to me and me alone.

322
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:15,108
So do we like Sprite, or
are we more of a 7-Up girl?

323
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,777
Uh, that all sounds great.

324
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:20,363
But, you know, the person you
should really be talking to

325
00:12:20,446 --> 00:12:22,115
is that guy.

326
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,367
- Yeah, okay, I'm done.
- Diane loves talking to him.

327
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,952
They have great rapport.

328
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:29,580
In fact, Diane could spend
all day talking to him

329
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:32,167
and never talk to me again.

330
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,629
Oh, I get it, because
Diane doesn't talk to Diane.

331
00:12:36,713 --> 00:12:39,757
- Diane talks to...
- Anybody else.

332
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:41,342
Hey, Todd, remember that time

333
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:42,969
when you wouldn't clean up your shit?

334
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,428
That was hilarious.

335
00:12:44,512 --> 00:12:46,430
- We've had some good times.
- Oh. Hi.

336
00:12:46,514 --> 00:12:48,266
So I was thinking, I have some...

337
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:51,228
pretty sloppy seconds
left over from P.F. Chang's

338
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,521
in the fridge, and I don't
think that I want it anymore.

339
00:12:53,604 --> 00:12:54,856
Maybe tonight you could eat it.

340
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:56,482
Friendly gesture because we're friends.

341
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:58,526
- Uh... - Oh-oh,
there's my guy.

342
00:12:58,609 --> 00:13:00,778
I heard you had a few more
thoughts about the script.

343
00:13:00,862 --> 00:13:01,863
I do.

344
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:04,615
I was just thinking, what if
we made the BoJack character

345
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:06,659
into a real shithead?

346
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:08,870
- Is that really necessary?
- I don't think it's necessary.

347
00:13:08,953 --> 00:13:12,582
Yeah, let's... Let's make
him be a real selfish asshole

348
00:13:12,665 --> 00:13:14,834
so the audience has
someone to root against.

349
00:13:14,918 --> 00:13:16,211
You're probably right.

350
00:13:16,294 --> 00:13:17,503
Let's take another swing at the script

351
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:19,047
and give BoJack more to do.

352
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,590
Now, when you say, "Give
BoJack more to do"...

353
00:13:20,673 --> 00:13:22,133
Not now, Mr. Peanutbutter.

354
00:13:22,217 --> 00:13:24,094
And also, now that I'm thinking about it,

355
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:27,889
why does the movie have
to take place on Earth?

356
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:30,600
You are blowing my head.

357
00:13:30,683 --> 00:13:32,476
- I hope you like Oscars.
- Honeydew?

358
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,604
More like, "Honey, do I enjoy eating it?

359
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:36,522
Yes, I do." Right?

360
00:13:36,606 --> 00:13:38,608
Not right, and I would love to
go through all the reasons why,

361
00:13:38,691 --> 00:13:40,151
but I've got bigger concerns right now.

362
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:42,361
- Honeydew, go on.
- Did you notice

363
00:13:42,445 --> 00:13:44,155
that the Mr. Peanutbutter
part has been cut in half?

364
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:46,866
- What is happening to our movie?
- I thought you hated the movie.

365
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,826
Yeah, I do, but if I'm
gonna be in a dumb movie

366
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,245
I hate that makes no sense,

367
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:51,996
I should at least be the star of it.

368
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,458
Look, I agree that this
movie has really lost its way.

369
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,877
I mean, first of all,
why would Mr. Peanutbutter

370
00:13:57,961 --> 00:13:59,712
wear a crew neck T-shirt?

371
00:13:59,796 --> 00:14:02,381
And second of all, uh...

372
00:14:02,465 --> 00:14:03,841
It's just the shirt, isn't it?

373
00:14:03,925 --> 00:14:05,093
It doesn't make sense.

374
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:06,427
I'm a V-neck man.

375
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,221
A V you can put your sunglasses in.

376
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,764
Can you do that with a crew neck?

377
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:11,599
Because I'd like to see you tr...

378
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:13,476
Whoa.

379
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:17,814
Bagel.

380
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,358
Thanks so much for
running this scene with me.

381
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:22,443
I have so many lines to learn.

382
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:24,862
Yeah, well, most of my
lines are, "True dat,"

383
00:14:24,946 --> 00:14:26,948
but I guess it never hurts to practice.

384
00:14:27,031 --> 00:14:30,076
The citizens of Planet
D want their king back.

385
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,787
But I'm more concerned with
getting my self-esteem back

386
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,040
after being in the shadow
of powerful men for so long.

387
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:37,208
True dat.

388
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:38,542
Is it just me, or is this movie

389
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:40,211
kind of flying off the rails?

390
00:14:40,295 --> 00:14:42,213
Well, I don't want to
overuse my catchphrase here,

391
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:43,673
but true dat.

392
00:14:43,756 --> 00:14:45,383
This is so typical.

393
00:14:45,508 --> 00:14:47,802
I just wanted to do something light and fun

394
00:14:47,885 --> 00:14:52,473
to distract me from the deep
well of sadness that is my life.

395
00:14:52,556 --> 00:14:54,309
You probably wouldn't understand.

396
00:14:54,392 --> 00:14:55,768
Oh, puh-lease.

397
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:57,645
I'm so deep down a well of sadness

398
00:14:57,728 --> 00:15:00,773
that Baby Jessica is like, "Damn."

399
00:15:00,857 --> 00:15:03,484
Shut up and kiss me, you miserable goof.

400
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:04,861
What?

401
00:15:04,944 --> 00:15:07,905
Oh. Okay. Mwah.

402
00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:09,615
Pop this in a drawer.

403
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:12,576
Huh?

404
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,330
This is good, baby.

405
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:16,873
Oh, this is amazing.

406
00:15:16,956 --> 00:15:18,916
Naomi, I haven't felt like this since...

407
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,084
No, no, shh, shh, shh!

408
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:22,295
Call me Diane.

409
00:15:24,505 --> 00:15:25,882
Okay, got my bagel.

410
00:15:25,965 --> 00:15:27,466
Now back to work.

411
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,344
Hey, guys.

412
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:30,845
Hey, guys!

413
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:34,515
Wow, wow.

414
00:15:34,598 --> 00:15:37,394
So you guys really hit it off, huh?

415
00:15:37,476 --> 00:15:38,895
That's awesome.

416
00:15:38,978 --> 00:15:40,397
Want to do some hand stuff in the bathroom

417
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:41,480
before we go down to set?

418
00:15:41,564 --> 00:15:42,857
You read my mind.

419
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,444
Now, kiss me some sour cream.

420
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:48,363
Hey, so I finished the book

421
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,198
and sent the draft to the publishers.

422
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:51,282
What? My book is ready?

423
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:52,367
Let me read it. Can I read it?

424
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,411
Call Pinky.

425
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:56,371
He'll probably send you a copy
as soon as he's done with it.

426
00:15:56,454 --> 00:15:57,997
All right! You hang tight, baby.

427
00:15:58,081 --> 00:15:59,623
I got an instant classic to read.

428
00:15:59,707 --> 00:16:00,708
Keep the engine running, though,

429
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,252
because if I know me,
this book is gonna give me

430
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:03,544
a pretty big erection.

431
00:16:03,627 --> 00:16:05,380
Okay, enjoy! Keep an open mind.

432
00:16:05,463 --> 00:16:07,090
You'll love it. It's a work in progress.

433
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:11,094
Hello. Penguin Publishing.

434
00:16:11,177 --> 00:16:12,678
Unless this is that loan shark,

435
00:16:12,762 --> 00:16:14,513
in which case, Johnny's House of Noodles.

436
00:16:14,597 --> 00:16:16,224
May I interest you in our bento lunch box?

437
00:16:16,515 --> 00:16:17,808
Pinky, it's me.

438
00:16:17,892 --> 00:16:19,143
Let me read the book.
Give me, give me, give me.

439
00:16:19,227 --> 00:16:21,020
Okay, okay, now, I should warn you,

440
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:24,607
it's not quite what we
expected, but it is good.

441
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,359
I'm telling you, this could really sell.

442
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,985
I might actually get to see my kids again.

443
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:29,070
Great. Send it over.

444
00:16:29,153 --> 00:16:30,529
I'll read it right now.

445
00:16:30,613 --> 00:16:32,282
All right, I sent it, but just remember...

446
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:34,867
To set my expectations sky-high?

447
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:36,327
Way ahead of you.

448
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:38,829
All right, book, let's see what you got.

449
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:41,749
BoJack, this is you.

450
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:43,376
One Trick Pony?

451
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,211
"The first time I met BoJack Horseman,

452
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,004
he was puking cotton candy off the deck

453
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:48,756
of his lavish house in the Hills,

454
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,716
the lights of the city twinkling below us.

455
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,593
The Make-A-Wish kids
will not soon forget

456
00:16:52,676 --> 00:16:54,804
the time the great BoJack Horseman

457
00:16:54,887 --> 00:16:58,015
referred to their parents as
'a bunch of used jizz bags.'

458
00:16:58,099 --> 00:17:01,060
He filled the air with
words, terrified of silence,

459
00:17:01,144 --> 00:17:03,396
as one often is who is
smart enough to recognize

460
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,899
his many personal failings
but unwilling or unable

461
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:08,651
to take the steps required to fix them.

462
00:17:08,734 --> 00:17:11,279
Got out of the car, stepped
out toward the coast,

463
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:13,114
and looked across the water,

464
00:17:13,197 --> 00:17:16,700
and for a moment, he said nothing."

465
00:17:16,784 --> 00:17:18,786
What the shit was that?

466
00:17:19,787 --> 00:17:21,498
What the shit is this?

467
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,582
It's a phone. Well, a
tiny computer, really.

468
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,126
I mean, amazing what technology can...

469
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:26,752
You were supposed to ghostwrite my memoir,

470
00:17:26,836 --> 00:17:28,463
but instead you wrote a
story about how you spent

471
00:17:28,546 --> 00:17:31,048
six months with me and saw
what a big, dumb loser I am.

472
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:33,301
Well, I realized that the best way

473
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:35,553
to fully capture you, warts and all...

474
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:37,472
This isn't warts and all. It's just warts.

475
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:38,515
Where's the all?

476
00:17:38,597 --> 00:17:40,183
I come off like a total asshole.

477
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:43,060
You come off as complex and deeply troubled

478
00:17:43,144 --> 00:17:44,479
but ultimately sympathetic.

479
00:17:44,562 --> 00:17:46,356
You might be too close to see that.

480
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:48,899
There's an entire chapter
about me eating apple fritters.

481
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:50,568
You did go through that fritter phase.

482
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:51,986
Is this book how you see me?

483
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:53,446
That day we ran errands together,

484
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,780
I thought that we had a really good time,

485
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:56,366
but you just wrote about how I cried

486
00:17:56,449 --> 00:17:58,117
because the dry cleaner
took my head shot down.

487
00:17:58,201 --> 00:17:59,618
You were very emotional.

488
00:17:59,702 --> 00:18:01,454
They didn't even replace me with anyone.

489
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,622
Now it's just a faded spot
where my face used to be.

490
00:18:03,706 --> 00:18:05,624
This will actually do
wonders for your career.

491
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,043
Trust me.

492
00:18:07,126 --> 00:18:09,003
I mean, you're just a dumb actor

493
00:18:09,086 --> 00:18:10,629
who doesn't know anything
about books, right?

494
00:18:10,713 --> 00:18:12,549
What?

495
00:18:12,631 --> 00:18:13,841
Remember? From before?

496
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:15,301
Oh, I don't think you understand

497
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,386
what's happening here.

498
00:18:16,469 --> 00:18:18,762
This is not a casual
conversation between friends.

499
00:18:18,846 --> 00:18:21,391
This is your boss telling his employee

500
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:22,933
that she did a bad job.

501
00:18:23,017 --> 00:18:24,977
- Try again.
- What?

502
00:18:25,061 --> 00:18:26,937
Start over, but do it right this time.

503
00:18:27,021 --> 00:18:29,440
Nobody is ever gonna see this.

504
00:18:30,608 --> 00:18:32,776
Ugh!

505
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,488
Diane?

506
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,574
Hey, Wayne, you still work for BuzzFeed?

507
00:18:37,656 --> 00:18:38,866
Um, yes.

508
00:18:38,949 --> 00:18:40,368
'Cause I got something that's gonna get you

509
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:44,080
a shit-ton of hearts or digs or smileys

510
00:18:44,163 --> 00:18:47,291
or whatever the hell you
measure your journalism with.

511
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,959
Curses!

512
00:18:49,043 --> 00:18:51,879
My evil plan has been
defeated, but I'll be back.

513
00:18:51,962 --> 00:18:53,297
You haven't heard the last

514
00:18:53,381 --> 00:18:56,593
of Evil Emperor BoJackitron Horsemaniac.

515
00:18:56,717 --> 00:18:57,718
Oh, no!

516
00:18:57,801 --> 00:18:59,303
You shot a laser at me!

517
00:18:59,387 --> 00:19:01,222
Oh, no! I'm dying.

518
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:03,641
Oh, no, I'm dead.

519
00:19:03,766 --> 00:19:05,602
And so now that we've escaped

520
00:19:05,684 --> 00:19:08,020
the evil clutches of the emperor,

521
00:19:08,104 --> 00:19:10,773
I'm free to assume my natural form,

522
00:19:10,856 --> 00:19:13,359
an all-knowing floating orb of light?

523
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,485
True dat.

524
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:16,112
Cut, cut.

525
00:19:16,195 --> 00:19:17,530
Come on, guys, this is ridiculous.

526
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,449
Is this even a movie anymore?

527
00:19:19,532 --> 00:19:22,452
Oh, maybe it isn't a movie.

528
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:25,079
Yeah, maybe it's an
immersive smartphone app

529
00:19:25,162 --> 00:19:29,917
or a 21st-century approach to
360-degree media envelopment.

530
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,879
Yeah, or maybe it's just,
like, a feeling, you know?

531
00:19:33,963 --> 00:19:35,673
- We've got work to do.
- Yeah, yeah.

532
00:19:35,756 --> 00:19:38,092
- Oh, my God, this is so good.
- Oh, this is gonna be awesome.

533
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:39,385
Yes! Go, Todd.

534
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,803
Hello?

535
00:19:40,886 --> 00:19:42,179
Are you just gonna leave me like this?

536
00:19:42,263 --> 00:19:43,264
Anyone?

537
00:19:43,347 --> 00:19:45,308
Ah!

538
00:19:45,391 --> 00:19:46,767
Oh, good. You're here.

539
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,227
Oh, hi, BoJack.

540
00:19:48,311 --> 00:19:49,853
This whole day's been a shit show.

541
00:19:49,937 --> 00:19:51,689
The book turned out to
be a total hatchet job.

542
00:19:51,772 --> 00:19:53,190
The movie's a disaster.

543
00:19:53,274 --> 00:19:55,693
But thank God I have one
good thing in my life,

544
00:19:55,776 --> 00:19:56,819
and that's you.

545
00:19:56,902 --> 00:19:58,279
BoJack, I...

546
00:19:58,362 --> 00:20:00,323
Please let me say this
before I lose my nerve.

547
00:20:00,406 --> 00:20:02,450
I spent 50 years roaming the countryside

548
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:05,077
as a wild stallion, but
I am tired of the rodeo,

549
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:06,663
and I'm finally ready to saddle up.

550
00:20:06,745 --> 00:20:07,746
BoJack...

551
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,290
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

552
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:11,584
this mustang wants to rest
his head in the comforts

553
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,043
of your spacious barn.

554
00:20:13,127 --> 00:20:14,337
Uh, what?

555
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,963
I'm in love with you, Naomi.

556
00:20:16,046 --> 00:20:17,298
BoJack, they fired me

557
00:20:17,381 --> 00:20:19,967
and replaced me with a ball on a stick.

558
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,051
I'm so sorry.

559
00:20:21,135 --> 00:20:22,679
But look at the bright side.

560
00:20:22,761 --> 00:20:24,888
Now you and I can just hang
out and talk about feelings.

561
00:20:24,972 --> 00:20:27,558
No, but you're not getting
it. Boys never get it.

562
00:20:27,642 --> 00:20:30,436
BoJack, I was in character as Diane,

563
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,648
and as Diane, we had a real connection.

564
00:20:33,731 --> 00:20:36,275
But now that I'm off the
movie, I'm Naomi again,

565
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:39,903
and Naomi is not interested
in BoJack Horseman.

566
00:20:39,987 --> 00:20:42,532
In fact, she thinks he's kind of gross.

567
00:20:42,615 --> 00:20:44,950
So I didn't fall in love with Naomi Watts?

568
00:20:45,034 --> 00:20:46,035
No.

569
00:20:46,118 --> 00:20:47,620
You fell in love with Diane.

570
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:50,122
Naomi what?

571
00:20:50,206 --> 00:20:51,832
Good-bye, BoJack.

572
00:20:51,915 --> 00:20:52,916
Ugh.

573
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,419
See? Nothing.

574
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:00,341
What's going on? Why are they packing up?

575
00:21:00,424 --> 00:21:02,510
Oh, glad you're here. This is exciting.

576
00:21:02,593 --> 00:21:04,428
Since we last talked,
this film has gone through

577
00:21:04,512 --> 00:21:06,430
- so many permutations.
- So many.

578
00:21:06,514 --> 00:21:08,140
First, we reimagined the whole film

579
00:21:08,224 --> 00:21:10,727
as an interactive social-media experience.

580
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:12,311
Those are the dumbest
words I've ever heard.

581
00:21:12,395 --> 00:21:13,396
I know.

582
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:15,314
So we realized it was actually

583
00:21:15,398 --> 00:21:17,066
more of a floating art installation,

584
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:18,735
but that didn't feel right either.

585
00:21:18,817 --> 00:21:20,361
We thought, is it a high-end perfume?

586
00:21:20,444 --> 00:21:22,279
A series of interrelated fortune cookies?

587
00:21:22,363 --> 00:21:25,282
A hat that if you turn it
upside down, it's a boat?

588
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:27,785
- No, it's none of those things.
- Exactly.

589
00:21:27,868 --> 00:21:29,912
That's why we finally settled on this.

590
00:21:29,995 --> 00:21:30,996
Voilà!

591
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,498
What am I looking at?

592
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:35,752
It is a bimonthly
curated box of snacks.

593
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:36,960
I don't know what that means.

594
00:21:37,044 --> 00:21:38,546
I know. It's confusing.

595
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:40,297
Not the bimonthly that means twice a month,

596
00:21:40,381 --> 00:21:42,800
the bimonthly that means every other month,

597
00:21:42,883 --> 00:21:45,678
and each time it's a
different box of snacks.

598
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,971
This is the future of cinema.

599
00:21:48,055 --> 00:21:52,059
You guys, finally, my story has been told.

600
00:21:52,142 --> 00:21:54,937
Okay, that's a wrap,
everyone.

601
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,940
Thanks for making this
box of snacks a reality.

602
00:21:58,023 --> 00:21:59,024
Let's go home.

603
00:22:00,943 --> 00:22:03,738
What the hell happened to the movie?

604
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:07,283
Shit, there were snacks
here the whole time?

605
00:22:07,366 --> 00:22:08,409
Not bad.

606
00:22:08,492 --> 00:22:10,035
- Whoa!
- Look, I get it.

607
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:11,704
You destroyed my big chance at a comeback

608
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,623
as revenge for what I
did to your rock opera.

609
00:22:13,706 --> 00:22:17,293
Revenge? Oh, that would
have been such a good idea.

610
00:22:17,376 --> 00:22:18,586
Damn it, Todd!

611
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:20,546
Look, I figured out what you did,

612
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,257
but I've been trying to put
it behind me and do my job.

613
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,218
So cutting my part down
was not about revenge?

614
00:22:26,343 --> 00:22:27,344
No.

615
00:22:27,428 --> 00:22:29,221
And making BoJack the villain of your movie

616
00:22:29,305 --> 00:22:31,890
was not a coded statement
of your feelings about me?

617
00:22:31,974 --> 00:22:32,975
No.

618
00:22:33,058 --> 00:22:34,769
Oh, okay, great.

619
00:22:34,852 --> 00:22:37,062
Well, I'm... I'm glad we buried the hatchet

620
00:22:37,146 --> 00:22:38,147
and everything's cool.

621
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,818
Uh, actually, you know,
everything is not cool.

622
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,361
You ruined my rock opera
by using character actress

623
00:22:44,445 --> 00:22:45,904
Margo Martindale to trick me

624
00:22:45,988 --> 00:22:47,615
into playing an addictive video game.

625
00:22:47,698 --> 00:22:49,533
And saying it all together like that,

626
00:22:49,617 --> 00:22:51,201
it all sounds kind of ludicrous.

627
00:22:51,285 --> 00:22:54,037
But still, it was something I cared about,

628
00:22:54,121 --> 00:22:56,540
and what you did really hurt me.

629
00:22:56,624 --> 00:22:58,793
Oh. Well, this feels shitty.

630
00:22:58,876 --> 00:23:01,462
You sure you don't want to just
get some revenge real quick...

631
00:23:01,545 --> 00:23:03,547
thump me once in the stones
and then we'll be even?

632
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,923
I got to go.

633
00:23:05,007 --> 00:23:09,094
I've got some artisanal popcorns
to gauge the mouthfeel of.

634
00:23:09,219 --> 00:23:10,847
- Hey, BoJack.
- Yeah?

635
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:12,181
You want an apple fritter?

636
00:23:12,264 --> 00:23:13,850
Uh, sure.

637
00:23:13,932 --> 00:23:15,518
Yeah, I bet you would.

638
00:23:15,601 --> 00:23:17,102
I bet you'd like an apple fritter.

639
00:23:17,186 --> 00:23:19,104
Yeah, an apple fritter would be great.

640
00:23:19,188 --> 00:23:21,565
Why? What... What... What's happening here?

641
00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:24,151
"Five Shocking Facts From New BoJack Book"?

642
00:23:24,234 --> 00:23:25,695
No. No!

643
00:23:25,778 --> 00:23:28,405
Um, everyone, please
turn off your Internet.

644
00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:29,866
It has gone bad.

645
00:23:29,948 --> 00:23:32,618
I repeat, the Internet has gone foul.

646
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,620
- What a loser.
- I'm glad I'm not that guy.

647
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,205
Give me your phones. I'm a celebrity.

648
00:23:36,288 --> 00:23:37,498
You have to listen to me.

649
00:23:37,581 --> 00:23:39,291
Look at his deep well of sadness.

650
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,251
It's hilarious.

651
00:23:41,335 --> 00:23:43,587
Don't look at me. I'm well-adjusted.

652
00:23:43,671 --> 00:23:45,882
You all want my life.

653
00:23:45,964 --> 00:23:47,424
Uh, what the hell?

654
00:23:47,508 --> 00:23:49,134
I know, I know. But if
you just listen for...

655
00:23:49,218 --> 00:23:50,720
You posted your dumb
little book on the Internet.

656
00:23:50,803 --> 00:23:52,638
No, I just leaked the
first couple chapters,

657
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,348
and people are already talking about it.

658
00:23:54,473 --> 00:23:57,518
This is wildly unprofessional.
Who do you think you are?

659
00:23:57,601 --> 00:23:59,478
I know you're mad, and
you have every right to be,

660
00:23:59,562 --> 00:24:01,104
but you got to read some of these comments.

661
00:24:01,188 --> 00:24:02,565
People love you.

662
00:24:02,648 --> 00:24:03,816
And they're gonna love you even more

663
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,776
when they read the rest of my book.

664
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,570
- Your book?
- Our book.

665
00:24:07,653 --> 00:24:09,321
Nobody is gonna read that book.

666
00:24:09,405 --> 00:24:10,573
How do you still not get that?

667
00:24:10,656 --> 00:24:12,742
It is never going to be published.

668
00:24:12,825 --> 00:24:15,118
BoJack, I stand by my work.

669
00:24:15,202 --> 00:24:16,954
This is a really good book.

670
00:24:17,037 --> 00:24:20,290
And if you just give it time, you'll see.

671
00:24:22,167 --> 00:24:23,460
Maybe you're right.

672
00:24:23,544 --> 00:24:24,754
Really?

673
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:26,589
No. You're fired.
