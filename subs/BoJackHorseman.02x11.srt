1
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,488
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:15,074
You said if I was in town
to give you a call.

3
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:18,142
- Wanna get a drink?
- It's eight in the morning.

4
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,770
It's 5:00 p.m. in Los Angeles.

5
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:22,063
- That's not true.
- I don't know what time it is.

6
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:24,942
When's the last time you slept?
You look like shit.

7
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:27,545
Really? 'Cause you look like a million...

8
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:31,114
- Yeah, let's get you back to my place.
- What about the store?

9
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:33,718
What if somebody has an emergency
and they need more...

10
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:35,076
turquoise shit?

11
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:36,286
It's New Mexico.

12
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:37,328
They'll find it.

13
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:40,123
- It's really good to see you.
- It's good to see you, too.

14
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:42,834
I can't wait for you
to meet Kyle and the kids.

15
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:45,980
Kyle and the kids? Please tell me
that's the name of your band.

16
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:22,290
So, who are you again?

17
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,626
You were friends with Mom
when she lived in L.A.?

18
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:28,254
Your mom never mentioned she used
to hang out with the BoJack Horseman?

19
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,632
Star of screen and... book?

20
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:33,384
- Wait, Mom lived in Los Angeles?
- Never came up?

21
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,512
- All these years?
- It was a long time ago.

22
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:38,139
Oh, gross. Mom, Trip has a boner again.

23
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,058
- Trip.
- Trip, let's dial back the boners.

24
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:41,726
- Gross.
- What? I can't help it.

25
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,520
- Trip, ew.
- You are at the breakfast table

26
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:46,272
with your parents, your big sister,
and an old man.

27
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,734
- What could possibly be arousing you?
- Am I the old man?

28
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,319
I don't understand how it works.

29
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,823
I was just excited that I finished
the maze on the back of the cereal box.

30
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,801
So, BoJack. What brings you to Tesuque?

31
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:58,702
So, we're just gonna change
the subject

32
00:01:58,703 --> 00:02:01,412
and pretend Trip isn't being a huge perv
right now?

33
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,040
Yeah, Penny, that's the plan.

34
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:05,500
Talking about it makes it worse.
It likes attention.

35
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:07,544
Charlotte told me if I was ever
in New Mexico

36
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:10,129
- I should call her.
- But what are you doing in New Mexico?

37
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,257
- Yeah, what are you doing in New Mexico?
- I, uh...

38
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,594
You didn't drive all this way
just to see my mom, did you?

39
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,221
No, of course not.

40
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:20,181
That would be crazy,

41
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,392
to come all this way just to see a woman

42
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:25,186
I haven't had a real conversation with
in 30 years.

43
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:28,356
- I mean, obviously, that would be crazy.
- Uh...

44
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:31,442
- Because she has a family, which is great.
- Yeah.

45
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,653
- You guys are great.
- Yeah.

46
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,948
So, I'm just here to, you know, say hello.

47
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:39,468
- Mm.
- On my way to see...

48
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,952
- On your way to sea?
- Yes.

49
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,204
To the sea. To the shining sea.

50
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,248
Because I'm here to buy... a boat.

51
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:49,086
- At the... Santa Fe Boat Show.
- I've never heard of a Santa Fe Boat Show.

52
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:51,462
That's 'cause... it's a secret boat show.

53
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,589
- Invitation-only.
- Huh.

54
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,361
Mostly athletes and visiting dignitaries
and big-time celebrities and... kings.

55
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:58,428
- Wow.
- Hold up.

56
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:02,015
If you live in Los Angeles,
which is right on the ocean,

57
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,392
why would you drive all the way here
to go to a boat show

58
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:07,979
- in the middle of landlocked New Mexico?
- Jeez, so many questions.

59
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,107
What is this,
Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities,

60
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:12,584
What Do They Know,
Do They Know Things, Let's Find Out?

61
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:16,487
Oh, gotta take this.
It's my... boat... guy.

62
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,156
- Hello?
- Okay, so I got Turtel...

63
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:19,884
Hey, Knute.

64
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:22,702
- You got any leads for me, boat-wise?
- What?

65
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:23,912
Sounds perfect, Knute.

66
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:26,497
- Now tell me, do we need a poop deck?
- Huh?

67
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,250
- Well, if Leo has one, then I want one.
- BoJack...

68
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:33,755
In fact, I want two, two poop decks.
Sorry about that. What's going on?

69
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:35,882
- Where the hell are you?
- Tesuque.

70
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,508
- Te-who-ka?
- Tesuque, New Mexico.

71
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,719
- Outside Santa Fe.
- Are you te-stupid?

72
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,347
If you don't get your ass back te-set,
you're gonna get te-sued.

73
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,517
- Just get me a couple of days.
- For what? What are you doing there?

74
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,978
I don't know, I just...

75
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:49,329
This isn't what I expected.

76
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,523
Well, I can probably stave them off
till Monday if you get pinkeye.

77
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,233
- Can you get pinkeye?
- I have to go.

78
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,611
Wait, BoJack, when are you coming back?

79
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,571
Soon. Yep, I want the starboard

80
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,364
- to be fully starboard.
- What?

81
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,261
- And the port to be... also starboard.
- Huh?

82
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,162
- Thanks a lot. Goodbye.
- Wait, BoJack...

83
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:07,080
- Hey.
- I'm really glad you're here.

84
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:09,124
Oh, yeah... uh, me, too.

85
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,001
I hope this isn't weird for you.

86
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:13,211
You know, me having a family and...

87
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,629
Why would it be weird?

88
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,482
At our age,
it's weird if you don't have a family.

89
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:19,926
- I mean...
- Well, not for you.

90
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,344
- No.
- 'Cause you've been busy.

91
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:22,595
- Right.
- With your career.

92
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:26,099
Sure, yeah,
my career has kept me super busy.

93
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,893
Anyway, I know you're just in town
for the boat show,

94
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,895
but seriously... make yourself at home.

95
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,480
I really don't want to impose.

96
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,899
If there's anything I can do
to help around here...

97
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,486
Mom, Dad was supposed to take me driving
after school today,

98
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:41,531
but now he's gotta take Trip
to his dumb-ass basketball game.

99
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:44,676
- It's the quarter-finals.
- You'll just get a hard-on in the game.

100
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:48,163
Now I will get a hard-on because
you made me think about it. Thanks a lot.

101
00:04:48,164 --> 00:04:51,457
- I'll take you driving this weekend.
- I need to practice every day.

102
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,960
I'm the only senior
who still doesn't have a license.

103
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,336
It's embarrassing.

104
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,215
Well, I got the store,
and I already took the morning off,

105
00:04:58,216 --> 00:05:00,217
so unless you know any other adults...

106
00:05:00,218 --> 00:05:01,259
Can BoJack take me?

107
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,177
- Huh?
- What?

108
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:03,928
- I mean, he is an adult.
- Uh...

109
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,847
Well, I mean, if it's okay with BoJack.

110
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:08,599
You'd really be doing me a huge favor.

111
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,871
Well, I guess I could make some time...
before the boat show.

112
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,069
Keep your eyes on the road,
both hands on the wheel.

113
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,154
- Okay.
- And don't text and drive,

114
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,405
unless it's an emergency,

115
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:25,801
like you have a really funny thing
that you just have to text someone.

116
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,995
- Got it.
- So, let me ask you something. Tsk.

117
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,914
Do your parents really love each other,

118
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:33,250
or is it
a stay-together-for-the-kids situation?

119
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:35,085
What? Why would you ask me that?

120
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:37,021
I don't know. Just making conversation.

121
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:40,048
- Why do we keep passing the same house?
- No, I don't. Shut up.

122
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:43,176
You shut up. What's the story?
Cute guy live there? Girl you hate?

123
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,928
College kid that gives you Adderall?

124
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:46,446
Okay, fine.

125
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,514
That's Diego Mendoza's house.

126
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,308
He's just this stupid guy.

127
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:53,144
He's in my calculus class,
and sometimes we'll do this thing

128
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,688
where he goes, "Hey,"
and then I go, "Hey."

129
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,149
Then he goes, "What's the homework?"
and I tell him.

130
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,586
It's not like a big deal or anything,
but it's like this thing we do.

131
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,422
- Cool thing.
- So, anyway...

132
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,699
My best friend, Alison F.
was talking to Rachel Kaplan.

133
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,600
Do I really need
to know these names?

134
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,494
Rachel heard from Ray-Ray
and the Bean

135
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,472
that Diego said
if prom happened right now

136
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,832
he'd want to go with Ali Sandler,
and I'm like,

137
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,418
"Yeah, pfft, okay, dude."
You know what I mean?

138
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,921
You know I don't know
any of these people, right?

139
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:22,673
But then he said
since prom's not for another two months,

140
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,802
he could "foresee a situation"
where he would want to go with me,

141
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:29,139
because he knows I'm a real girl
who's mostly chill.

142
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,183
If you're so mostly chill,
why do you keep driving by his house?

143
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:35,228
In case he comes out,
to, like, check the mail or something.

144
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,939
I'll get out of the car and be like,
"That's so funny.

145
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,398
I was just going for a drive."

146
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,152
And he'll be like, "Oh, hey."
And I'll be like, "Hey."

147
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:45,571
- 'Cause that's our thing, you know? Heh.
- That's the whole plan?

148
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:49,159
Well, it's better than your plan
for buying a boat in New Mexico.

149
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,679
Dude, what are you really doing here?

150
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:59,210
I didn't... like the person I was in L.A.

151
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:02,755
And I didn't know where else to go.

152
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,216
- Please do not tell your parents.
- Well, I won't,

153
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:06,759
but I think people are gonna notice

154
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,053
if you go to a boat show
and don't come back with a boat.

155
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,390
Oh, my God, there he is. Get down!

156
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:13,975
- Oh, my God. Oh!
- What are you doing?

157
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:16,102
- What happened to your plan?
- Oh! I panicked.

158
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,497
I didn't know
he'd be wearing a tank top.

159
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:25,003
- Don't tell my parents I crashed your car.
- Yeah, deal.

160
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,284
- They didn't even put me in.
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.

161
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,137
You did some great cheering
from the bench,

162
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:35,496
and for someone who never plays,
you sweat a lot.

163
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,082
- Maybe they'll put me in next game.
- Sure, they will.

164
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,959
No way they'll do that.

165
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,171
- What the...?
- Huh?

166
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:44,797
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

167
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,132
What a boat.

168
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,426
- Can I go on your boat?
- I don't see what's stopping you.

169
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:51,679
Yeah! Woo-hoo! I'm going on a boat!
I got my way!

170
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,763
Where's your car?

171
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,159
I junked it.
Who needs a car when you got a boat?

172
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:58,019
- Uh... well...
- Whoa, sweet, a waterbed.

173
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,398
On a boat!
Think of the amount of floating!

174
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,107
Please stay out of the bedroom.

175
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,567
- Does she have a name?
- Who?

176
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:08,238
- The boat? It does not.
- Come on. You gotta give her a name.

177
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:10,448
You should call her the Escape From L.A.

178
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:13,368
That actually is a good name for it,
the nongendered object.

179
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:15,179
Oh, she's a good girl.

180
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:18,331
I can tell,
she's a good girl, isn't she?

181
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:21,459
- Or are you a bad girl?
- Are you flirting with my boat right now?

182
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,503
No, just kidding around.
I'm kind of the comedian of the family.

183
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,006
- Mind if I get on top of her?
- Knock yourself out.

184
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,591
Dad, don't be gross.

185
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:31,177
- Wow, you really got a boat.
- Yeah, sure did.

186
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,137
So, does that mean you're leaving?

187
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,722
Oh, I, uh...

188
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:39,060
Yeah, I guess, uh... I guess I did...
do what I came here to do.

189
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:42,939
You don't have to go right away, right?
At least stay till the end of the weekend.

190
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,691
- Yeah? I don't wanna put you out.
- Oh, it's no bother.

191
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:49,862
And at least now you have your own bed.
Besides... heh, everyone here loves you.

192
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,364
Uh, everyone?

193
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,925
Don't use the bathroom.
It'll end up in the driveway.

194
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:57,429
- Too late.
- Seriously, stay as long as you want.

195
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,958
- What?
- BoJack, great news.

196
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,627
Do you still want to go to New York?
Because Jill Pill...

197
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,337
Jill Pill? I don't care about this.

198
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:09,299
Okay, moving on. Do you remember
when we were at Herb's funeral

199
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,634
- and you told me...?
- Whatever it is, I don't care.

200
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,886
Oh, there's a kitchen!
Can we make pizza bagels?

201
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,513
Yeah, family dinner on the boat.

202
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:18,724
Hey, uh, I'm not gonna be back
on set Monday.

203
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:22,103
What? How long do I have
to keep putting out fires for you?

204
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:24,623
I don't know, Princess Carolyn.
Just let them burn.

205
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:27,024
- What?
- I think I might be here a while.

206
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,668
Listen, I...

207
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:35,366
Well, who's getting seasick?

208
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,637
Just kidding.

209
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,747
It's such an eyesore.

210
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,394
Well, I'm sure if we ask them nicely,
they'll move the boat.

211
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,716
BoJack?

212
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,945
- Yeah?
- Supper's ready.

213
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,306
So, I had another meeting today
with the Drama Chair at SFCC.

214
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:00,224
They're gonna offer me a position.

215
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:03,144
- What? That's amazing.
- Oh, that's cool. Congratulations.

216
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:07,148
There's a real stick-in-the-mud dean there
who doesn't like my in-your-face style.

217
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:12,111
If I know me, it might lead
to some pretty zany misadventures.

218
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,946
Mm. Brussels sprouts are delicious, Mom.

219
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:18,075
It's funny you brought up the Brussels
sprouts, because I think they're terrible.

220
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,745
I'm just kidding around.
These are great, hon.

221
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,291
Penny, did you hear my bit
about the Brussels sprouts?

222
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:28,252
A bit is what they call a joke
in show business.

223
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,795
- Right, BoJack?
- That's right.

224
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,507
String a bunch of those together
and you got yourself a riff.

225
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:35,885
You're not funny, Dad.
Your jokes are never funny.

226
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:37,970
Okay... I think someone's in a mood.

227
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,597
Oh, my God. I'm not in a mood.

228
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,391
Whatever. Get bent.

229
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:43,601
I hate my life. I can't wait to be dead.

230
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,062
I'll talk to her.

231
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:47,355
Everyone said for months

232
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,458
- that Diego was gonna ask me to prom.
- Yeah?

233
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:52,443
- But he keeps not doing it.
- That is so typical Diego.

234
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:55,530
So, I thought, okay,
if he's not going to ask me, I'll ask him.

235
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:57,198
- Way to take initiative.
- Oh. Rookie mistake.

236
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:58,949
So, I asked him and he said no.

237
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,721
And then this other girl, Lyla K.,
came up to him and was just like, "Hey."

238
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,456
And he was like, "Hey."
And that's our thing.

239
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:07,708
Well, I don't want to tell tales
out of school,

240
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:11,879
but this Lyla K. character
sounds like a real bust-ass super-skank.

241
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,674
Thank you, that is exactly what she is.
It's weird that nobody talks about it.

242
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,386
Well, you know, sometimes it's nice
to not have a date,

243
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:19,970
- because you can actually...
- Mom.

244
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:23,807
I can't go to the prom without a date.
It's not like when you were in high school

245
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,394
- and you'd go to your sock hops.
- Do you think

246
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:29,439
- I went to high school in the '50s?
- Penny, hey, I got an idea.

247
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,981
- You should take me to the prom.
- Huh?

248
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,858
Everybody loves having BoJack around.

249
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,026
What? Why?

250
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,737
Think about it. If you went with Diego,
you'd be nervous.

251
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,531
"Does he like me? Am I cool?"

252
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,492
But with me you can just relax
and enjoy yourself.

253
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,762
Diego will see you
have a good time without him,

254
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,496
and that'll make him super jealous.

255
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,998
So, he'll come up to you,
and he'll say, "Hey."

256
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,750
And then you say, "Hey."

257
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,752
- Oh, that's so cold.
- Right?

258
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,004
- Wait...
- Rachel Kaplan's gonna shit herself.

259
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,382
- How is that cold?
- Then he'll say, "Wanna dance?"

260
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,926
And you'll say,
"I'm busy right now. Maybe later."

261
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,887
And then... never dance with him.

262
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,181
- That'll show him.
- Wait... I'm sorry.

263
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,934
- Don't you want to dance with Diego?
- Stop poking holes, Charlotte.

264
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,437
- This is a great plan.
- Yeah, Mom, don't poke holes.

265
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:11,665
Hey, Dad, BoJack's taking me to prom!

266
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:16,461
Oh, yeah, well,
that's definitely the better idea.

267
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,698
Okay, everyone smile. Real big.

268
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,033
- Cheese.
- I think we have enough pictures.

269
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,554
Oh, come on, it's your first prom.
Indulge us.

270
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,205
Taking pictures before prom
is so bourgeois.

271
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,457
And who are you again?

272
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,959
- I'm Maddy.
- Maddy's my best friend.

273
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,422
- I thought Alison F. was your best friend.
- That was like three best friends ago.

274
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:40,009
You were best friends
with Alison F.?

275
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,012
- No.
- Hey, BoJack, I'm Pete.

276
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:47,057
But they call me Pete Repeat
because I always say everything twice.

277
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:50,060
- Everything?
- Yeah, it's kind of my thing.

278
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,496
- Okay.
- Ah, damn.

279
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:54,064
I forgot to say that twice, didn't I?
Usually I do it.

280
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,041
Cool.

281
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,531
Wow, Ray-Ray and the Bean
are already posting pics on Instagram.

282
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:03,366
- What?
- Hashtag much?

283
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:04,367
Let me see.

284
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:06,327
Whoa, hold on. Responsible adult.

285
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:08,179
- What are you drinking?
- Nothing.

286
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:11,207
- Hand it over.
- Fine.

287
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:15,586
Ugh. Red Bull and vodka? What are you, 12?
You'll get sick drinking all that sugar.

288
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,565
Do they teach you anything in school?
Make a left at the light.

289
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,900
- Where are we going?
- I'll get you some bourbon.

290
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,969
And you'll cut it with water.
That way you don't get hungover.

291
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,012
Wait, really?

292
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,765
If you're gonna drink,
you should be smart about it.

293
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:30,768
Awesome. Wait.
How many times did I just say "awesome"?

294
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,145
Was it twice or was it once?
Ah, it was probably twice.

295
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,540
Yeah, it's twice. Pete Repeat.

296
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:44,741
- Ugh. It burns.
- Yeah, 'cause it's not a juice box.

297
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:45,949
You want some?

298
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,284
- No, thanks.
- Pussy.

299
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,369
I'm driving.

300
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,387
Well, more for me.

301
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:51,723
This prom is really bourgeois.

302
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:55,209
- Lyla K. is so pretty.
- Shut up. She's got nothing on you.

303
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:59,004
Why is nobody dancing?
We gotta get this party started.

304
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,215
Beat it, Poindexter.

305
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:03,259
- Poindexter?
- It's a nerd reference...

306
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,444
- Just beat it.
- Ah!

307
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:05,469
Huh?

308
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,596
- Hey!
- What's the big idea?

309
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:10,224
Why is there an adult
at our high school prom?

310
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,476
All right, folks.
We're taking it back to 1991,

311
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:16,188
when a new funky-fresh dance craze
took this nation by storm.

312
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,856
- All right.
- I'm listening.

313
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,568
As a teen, I'm open to new experiences.

314
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:24,781
Ready for the chorus, stay on the beat,
and here... we... go. Waka waka.

315
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:27,366
Now boys and girls,
if you wanna do the BoJack,

316
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,744
- take your hands and put them on your...
- Boo!

317
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:31,805
- This sucks.
- This guy's bad.

318
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,290
God, no! This is not
the immediate praise I expected.

319
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:39,336
This prom sucks.

320
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,504
You can say that again.

321
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,715
- I know.
- My flask got empty.

322
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:46,176
Can we be back to the car,
so, for more get for put in it?

323
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,345
Or we could go back to the car
and just leave.

324
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,974
- You can't just leave the prom.
- Of course you can. You're young.

325
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,601
You can do whatever you want.

326
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:54,977
That's what they never tell you

327
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:57,605
until it's too late.
You don't have to be here.

328
00:14:57,606 --> 00:15:00,357
Yeah, is right. Society is everywhere.

329
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,360
- Society.
- Well, what else are we gonna do?

330
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,863
I'd say it's time to get down,
time to hit the town.

331
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:08,574
Is that a lyric
from that "Do the BoJack" song?

332
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,635
Just get in the car.

333
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:23,106
Okay, one... two... three.

334
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,136
Wow. That is so beautiful.

335
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:32,598
Hey, you wanna climb up
on the water tower?

336
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,099
We could see the whole city.

337
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,226
Yeah, I wanna go.

338
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:37,936
Oh.

339
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,396
Oh, careful there, Maddy.

340
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,207
Actually, I'm gonna stay right here.

341
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,251
This is nice.

342
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,571
Wow, how'd you think to do all this?

343
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,948
I don't know. It just came to me.

344
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,326
I'm really glad we left that stupid prom,

345
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:55,221
but I'm kind of bummed
we didn't get to dance.

346
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,331
Well, you wanna dance?

347
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,124
Yes, hold on.

348
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,584
Got it, okay.

349
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,881
It's buffering.

350
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:08,175
Buffering still, buffering.

351
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:11,303
This night has been... so perfect.

352
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,490
You know, you look just like your mother.

353
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,226
Guys?

354
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,746
I think you should come down here.

355
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,606
She's still breathing,
but she won't wake up.

356
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,442
She just had too much to drink.
Take her back to your place.

357
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,570
- She can spend the night.
- Maddy, come on.

358
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:30,447
No, look, my cousin had a friend
who passed out like this,

359
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:33,367
and she died of alcohol poisoning, man.

360
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:36,537
I really think we should get Maddy
to a hospital, to a hospital.

361
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:39,766
Did you see what I did there?
That's why they call me Pete Repeat.

362
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,185
BoJack, what do we do?

363
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,007
- Society.
- Careful.

364
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,342
- I'm being careful.
- Okay.

365
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,094
- Lock the wheels.
- Watch her head.

366
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:54,847
Maddy's gonna be just fine.
They'll know what to do here.

367
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,014
Pete, you're in charge.

368
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,016
- Penny and I are gonna take off.
- What?

369
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,437
You don't want too many people around
in a hospital setting.

370
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,773
If anyone asks,
tell them we left the dance early,

371
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:06,191
and you don't know
where Maddy got the whiskey.

372
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,109
Why?

373
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,862
It's one thing if a bunch of kids
get drunk on prom night,

374
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,949
but if there's an adult there,
I was supposed to be responsible,

375
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,117
and then the whole thing feels
kind of creepy.

376
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:16,786
Are you sure she's gonna be okay?

377
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:18,621
- I don't know, BoJack.
- Pete.

378
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:21,058
I'm the adult here,
and I need you to listen to me.

379
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:24,042
Penny and I left early.
You don't know who gave Maddy whiskey.

380
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,168
Are we clear on this?

381
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,212
I need you to be 100 percent with me here.

382
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,338
Uh...

383
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,466
Just listen to him.
He knows what he's doing.

384
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,760
It's gonna be okay.
Where did Maddy get the alcohol from?

385
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:35,888
I... I don't know.

386
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,891
And what happened to your friends
BoJack and Penny?

387
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,977
They left early.

388
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:42,812
See, that's not so hard.

389
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:45,439
You're doing the right thing.
Don't forget that.

390
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,276
- Okay.
- Is it okay?

391
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,194
Or "okay" okay?

392
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,323
- Uh... "okay" okay.
- All right, that's what I thought.

393
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:57,117
You're the future of America!
Go, Penny! Go, go, go!

394
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:02,766
- She's gonna be okay, right?
- She'll be fine.

395
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,082
It's a part of growing up.

396
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,645
And we did the right thing back there,
you think?

397
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:10,589
I...
Look, sometimes when you're an adult,

398
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,800
the right thing
isn't always the best thing.

399
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,111
Well...

400
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,137
I had a really good time tonight.

401
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,097
Even with all the craziness.

402
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,058
This was really special.

403
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,225
I'm glad.

404
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,354
You know, everyone always treats me
like a kid.

405
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:29,107
You're the first grown-up I've ever met
who actually treats me like...

406
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,943
you know, a person.

407
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:33,988
So, thanks. Mwah.

408
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:35,739
- Well, you're welcome, Penny.
- Mm...

409
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,408
- Whoa, Penny, come on.
- If you want to do it, I'm ready.

410
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,161
I have condoms in my room.
I can put one on with my mouth.

411
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,890
- With your mouth?
- I put one on a banana in health class.

412
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,375
With your mouth?
What kind of health class...?

413
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:49,003
Look, you are an amazing person,
but you're 17.

414
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,463
Which is the legal age of consent
in New Mexico.

415
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,798
Okay, that's not...

416
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,551
And I didn't drink tonight,
so everything's totally legal.

417
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:58,470
- Penny, no.
- It's okay. I want this.

418
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,531
No, you think you do, but...

419
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,742
You don't know what you want.

420
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:06,603
Oh, God.

421
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,064
This is so dumb.

422
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:10,917
- No, Penny, don't...
- I'll see you tomorrow.

423
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,116
Hey.

424
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,702
- What'd you do with my daughter?
- She had a big night.

425
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:24,747
She was falling asleep on the ride home.
Where are the boys?

426
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,184
Trip's at a friend's house
and Kyle's asleep.

427
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,545
- You know you can get your own, right?
- Hey, do you remember that time

428
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:34,214
you, me and Herb let those balloons go
over Studio City?

429
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:37,593
Oh, yeah. Didn't we attach glow sticks
to them or something?

430
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:38,969
- Yeah.
- Ooh. That was really bad

431
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:39,929
for the environment.

432
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,805
- True, but...
- A seagull could've choked

433
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,767
- on one of those balloons.
- But it's a nice memory, right?

434
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:46,393
It was a fun night.

435
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,520
We had a lot of fun nights.

436
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,941
Before you left town,
you told me L.A. was a tar pit.

437
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,358
- Do you remember?
- Oh, God.

438
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,570
I said so many things when I was young.
I thought I was so deep.

439
00:19:56,571 --> 00:20:00,574
- Well, do you still think it's true?
- Do I think L.A. is a tar pit?

440
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:01,951
No.

441
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:03,953
No, I think you're the tar pit.

442
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:06,538
- Me?
- No, not "you" you.

443
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,266
I'm just saying, like...

444
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:11,251
It doesn't matter where you are,
it's who you are,

445
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:14,046
and that's not gonna change
whether you're in California

446
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:17,275
or Maine or New Mexico.

447
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,635
You know, you can't escape... you.

448
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:24,598
- Ugh. Now you sound like my mother.
- No, what? No, I don't.

449
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:30,479
- I don't know what to do, Charlotte.
- About what?

450
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,398
I keep... making these bad decisions.

451
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,669
- And hurting people.
- Well...

452
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,738
- Can I tell you a joke?
- Is it a long joke with no punch line?

453
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,239
- No.
- Then go ahead.

454
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,535
Guy goes into the doctor's office.
Says, "Doctor, it hurts when I do this."

455
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:46,996
You know what the doctor says?

456
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:49,557
- "Don't do that."
- Yeah.

457
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,751
- That's actually... good advice.
- And you know what else?

458
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,587
The doctor in that story was a woman.

459
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,880
What?!

460
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,891
Oh. BoJack, um...

461
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:10,727
- I think you got the wrong idea.
- Let's go.

462
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:12,896
- Let's get out of here right now.
- No, BoJack.

463
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,332
You and me, this is real.

464
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:16,942
- You know this is real.
- My husband is right upstairs.

465
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:19,611
I don't care about your husband.
All that matters is us.

466
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,405
- Don't do this, BoJack.
- I know you feel it, too.

467
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,825
So many times in my life
I've done the wrong thing,

468
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,202
but this is the right thing,

469
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:28,411
and I have never been more sure
of anything.

470
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,747
I've wasted so much time sitting
on my hands

471
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,976
and imagining what could have been.

472
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:36,395
Tell me you don't feel the same.
Tell me you haven't thought about it.

473
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:41,133
- I think you should go.
- Okay.

474
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,051
- Tomorrow.
- Charlotte...

475
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:44,761
I have worked very hard to build this life
for myself.

476
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:45,971
I am happy here.

477
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,640
And you just roll into my life
like a hurricane.

478
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:52,186
Why? Because we knew each other
for five minutes 30 years ago?

479
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:53,562
- I don't know you.
- You do.

480
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:55,856
I don't. And you don't know me.

481
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:58,650
No, please.
These last few months have been amazing.

482
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,777
- I love you, your family and this town.
- Stop.

483
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,529
- I never wanted to hurt...
- BoJack...

484
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:06,033
I'm sorry I kissed you. I shouldn't have.
We can pretend it didn't happen.

485
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:09,053
- Everything can go back to normal, but...
- No, no, stop. No.

486
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,580
Please, don't make me go back to L.A.

487
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:15,101
I don't care where you go, BoJack,
but I can't have you around here.

488
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,854
You make me too sad.

489
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,439
Okay.

490
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:26,529
What are you doing here?

491
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:29,448
I know what I want, BoJack.

492
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,745
Go to bed, Penny.

493
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:50,553
Wait, what?

494
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,979
Shh, shh, shh.
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

495
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:09,721
- No.
- Mom.

496
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,514
- Charlotte.
- Penny, go to your room.

497
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,910
- We didn't even do anything.
- Now, Penny.

498
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:21,358
- Charlotte, I am so sorry...
- Don't. Don't you dare.

499
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,779
If you are not out of my driveway
in 30 minutes, I will call the police.

500
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,950
And if you ever try to contact me
or my family again,

501
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:32,387
I will fucking kill you.

502
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,156
Hey.

503
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:34,723
Hey.

504
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:36,392
You're still here?

505
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:39,287
Yep, still here.

506
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,586
Boxer versus raptor.
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.
