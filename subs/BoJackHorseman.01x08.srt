00:11:19,016 --> 00:11:20,226
Now, I gotta go.

324
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:23,145
I got a lunch with MC Skat Kat.

325
00:11:24,856 --> 00:11:26,608
[man on TV] Scandal breaking today

326
00:11:26,691 --> 00:11:29,193
surrounding the family
sitcom, Horsin' Around.

327
00:11:29,277 --> 00:11:30,946
Oh, God. What did I do this time?

328
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:32,948
Herb Kazzaz, the show's creator,

329
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,617
was caught tonight in an LAPD sting

330
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,285
- on public indecency.
- Wha...

331
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:38,995
Police say Mr. Kazzaz
was caught in the middle

332
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:41,247
of lewd acts with another man.

333
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,458
Conservative groups have
been quick to organize.

334
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,877
Horsin' Around is a show for kids.

335
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:48,588
My family should be able to
watch those nubile preteens

336
00:11:48,671 --> 00:11:51,048
without men like perv Kazzaz flaunting

337
00:11:51,132 --> 00:11:53,384
their alternative lifestyles
and ruining America.

338
00:11:53,468 --> 00:11:58,974
Sheeeiiiiit.

339
00:12:01,893 --> 00:12:03,645
BoJack, I gotta tell ya.

340
00:12:03,728 --> 00:12:06,147
- I'm gay.
- No doy.

341
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,484
I know we haven't been close
for the past couple years.

342
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:10,860
Okay, I'm gonna hold back my "No doys"

343
00:12:10,944 --> 00:12:11,987
because there might be a lot.

344
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:13,362
But you know me, right?

345
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:14,990
You know that I'm a good guy.

346
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:16,741
They're gunning for me at the network,

347
00:12:16,825 --> 00:12:19,285
and if I get kicked off
this, I won't recover.

348
00:12:19,368 --> 00:12:21,120
I need to know that you've got my back.

349
00:12:21,203 --> 00:12:24,165
If you threaten to walk,
they'll listen to you.

350
00:12:24,248 --> 00:12:26,417
Herb, you picked the
worst possible time to...

351
00:12:26,501 --> 00:12:29,629
Hey, you know I wouldn't
ask if I didn't need it.

352
00:12:29,712 --> 00:12:31,631
Come on, BoJack.

353
00:12:31,714 --> 00:12:33,800
How'd we get so far apart, huh?

354
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:35,969
[sighs]

355
00:12:36,052 --> 00:12:38,930
You know what? You can count on me, Herb.

356
00:12:39,014 --> 00:12:41,140
I mean, I wouldn't even be
here if it weren't for you.

357
00:12:41,223 --> 00:12:43,601
I knew it! I knew you'd come through.

358
00:12:43,685 --> 00:12:45,436
And when this is all over, we're going

359
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,104
to drive back up to Griffith Park.

360
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:49,357
I still owe you that high five, right?

361
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,984
Hey, this is a dumb question,

362
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:52,944
but do you guys ever,
like, all link up together

363
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:54,988
and do, like, a party
train or a fun circle?

364
00:12:55,071 --> 00:12:56,489
'Cause I feel like I'd
be doing that all the...

365
00:12:56,572 --> 00:12:57,824
Never mind. Stupid question.

366
00:12:57,907 --> 00:12:59,450
Feel stupid for asking that.

367
00:12:59,534 --> 00:13:03,120
- [crowd shouting]
- [barking]

368
00:13:03,204 --> 00:13:04,580
Go right ahead.

369
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:06,708
And then it goes, "I like healthy gums

370
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,167
in a major way."

371
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,544
See, that's what I'm talking about.

372
00:13:09,627 --> 00:13:11,128
That's great.

373
00:13:11,212 --> 00:13:13,089
We just gotta make sure
that we work in the phrase

374
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:15,717
"toothbrush rap" early,
so they know I'm rapping.

375
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,972
BoJack, can we chat for a second?

376
00:13:21,056 --> 00:13:24,684
Ugh. Here we go. It's the big one.

377
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:27,144
I'm not gonna waste
your time with small talk

378
00:13:27,228 --> 00:13:29,313
because you work for me,
and your time is my time.

379
00:13:29,397 --> 00:13:31,024
We're letting Herb go.

380
00:13:31,107 --> 00:13:32,692
- You can't do that.
- "I can't do that."

381
00:13:32,775 --> 00:13:34,610
I'm not asking you. It's nothing personal.

382
00:13:34,694 --> 00:13:36,696
I like Herb. I think he's a good guy.

383
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,322
But this is a business, and every day

384
00:13:38,406 --> 00:13:39,866
we don't fire him, we're flushing money

385
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:41,701
- down the crapper.
- Well, if he goes, I go.

386
00:13:41,784 --> 00:13:42,994
"Well, if he goes, you
go." I wouldn't do that.

387
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:44,704
BoJack, I think you're a star,

388
00:13:44,787 --> 00:13:47,832
and sometimes being a star
means making tough choices.

389
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,085
You can storm out, make a big show out of

390
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:51,460
what a "good" friend you are,

391
00:13:51,544 --> 00:13:53,379
or you could be the guy who does his job.

392
00:13:53,462 --> 00:13:54,839
- Angela...
- I'll tell you when

393
00:13:54,923 --> 00:13:56,632
it's your turn to talk again.

394
00:13:56,716 --> 00:13:58,760
Look, you're a star,
but this is really just

395
00:13:58,843 --> 00:14:01,054
the beginning of the BoJack Horseman story.

396
00:14:01,137 --> 00:14:03,472
You can choose whatever path you want,

397
00:14:03,556 --> 00:14:05,016
but I'll tell you right now.

398
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,684
You don't win awards and you don't

399
00:14:06,768 --> 00:14:08,603
get to be on the covers of magazines

400
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:10,438
and you don't get to play the lead role

401
00:14:10,521 --> 00:14:13,274
in the Secretariat movie
by being a good friend.

402
00:14:13,357 --> 00:14:15,985
What's that old expression
about how the show must go on?

403
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:18,821
Oh, right. It's "Don't be an idiot."

404
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:22,117
So what do you think, BoJack?
That's a courtesy question.

405
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:24,744
I already know what you think
because I have conversations

406
00:14:24,827 --> 00:14:26,412
like this one five times a day.

407
00:14:26,495 --> 00:14:28,372
I know who you are, and I know

408
00:14:28,456 --> 00:14:29,457
you've already made your decision.

409
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,126
But if you want to surprise me,

410
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,585
now's the time to do it.

411
00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:34,420
That's what I thought.

412
00:14:34,503 --> 00:14:36,380
You're doing the right
thing. I know it's hard.

413
00:14:36,464 --> 00:14:38,549
But if Herb's really your
friend, he'll understand.

414
00:14:38,633 --> 00:14:40,593
Now, you've got a show to put on,

415
00:14:40,676 --> 00:14:42,053
so I'll let you get ready.

416
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:44,430
This was a good conversation. Productive.

417
00:14:44,513 --> 00:14:48,225
If you're lucky, I'll
never talk to you again.

418
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:49,894
[cup thuds]

419
00:14:49,978 --> 00:14:52,521
[sighs]

420
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:54,565
[announcer] You folks ready for a show?

421
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:56,025
[audience cheering]

422
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:57,735
'Cause I think a certain someone

423
00:14:57,819 --> 00:14:59,904
might show up any second.

424
00:14:59,988 --> 00:15:03,992
[applause]

425
00:15:04,075 --> 00:15:06,953
[sighs]

426
00:15:07,036 --> 00:15:08,370
- [cheers and applause]
- Wait a minute.

427
00:15:08,454 --> 00:15:10,039
This isn't the bar.

428
00:15:10,123 --> 00:15:12,041
I gotta fire my assistant.

429
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,626
[laughter]

430
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,631
So what ended up
happening with Secretariat?

431
00:15:18,714 --> 00:15:20,257
Went into turnaround.

432
00:15:20,341 --> 00:15:21,926
I don't totally know
what "turnaround" means,

433
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,887
- but they never made the movie.
- Whoa.

434
00:15:24,971 --> 00:15:28,099
This house is way bigger than yours.

435
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:31,102
Herb's done really well
for a guy you dicked over.

436
00:15:31,186 --> 00:15:32,728
- Oh, no. Ah.
- That's enough out of you.

437
00:15:32,812 --> 00:15:34,313
Stay out here and turn this car around

438
00:15:34,396 --> 00:15:36,191
in case we need to leave in a hurry.

439
00:15:36,273 --> 00:15:38,151
Hooray. A task.

440
00:15:38,234 --> 00:15:40,028
[doorbell rings]

441
00:15:40,111 --> 00:15:41,196
[sighs]

442
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:42,738
[coughs]

443
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:44,782
BoJack! Well.

444
00:15:44,866 --> 00:15:46,492
Jesus, you look shitty.

445
00:15:46,575 --> 00:15:49,120
Have you been eating your
guilt this whole time?

446
00:15:49,204 --> 00:15:52,331
[all laugh]

447
00:15:52,414 --> 00:15:54,583
Yeah, you don't look so hot yourself, Herb.

448
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:57,879
I have cancer.

449
00:15:57,962 --> 00:16:00,215
And hello. Who's this stunning creature?

450
00:16:00,297 --> 00:16:01,757
And what string of bad decisions

451
00:16:01,841 --> 00:16:03,300
has placed you in BoJack's orbit?

452
00:16:03,384 --> 00:16:04,844
- Uh...
- This is Diane.

453
00:16:04,927 --> 00:16:06,345
She's writing a book about me.

454
00:16:06,428 --> 00:16:08,056
Pleasure to meet you.

455
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:10,266
Is your book called,
Portrait of an Asshole?

456
00:16:10,349 --> 00:16:12,018
[laughs] I kid.

457
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:13,936
It's funny, because he ruined my life.

458
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,354
I joke. It's what I do.

459
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:16,731
Please, come in.

460
00:16:16,814 --> 00:16:17,815
You're letting out all the cancer.

461
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:19,192
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

462
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:20,818
[forced laugh]

463
00:16:20,902 --> 00:16:22,237
Ha ha...

464
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:23,821
Almost. Ah...

465
00:16:23,905 --> 00:16:26,115
Almost there.

466
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:28,243
Come on... ah.

467
00:16:28,325 --> 00:16:30,536
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.
- [bear growls]

468
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:33,372
BoJack, how are your utensils?

469
00:16:33,455 --> 00:16:35,083
- Uh, they're fine.
- Are you sure?

470
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,876
Because if that knife ain't sharp enough,

471
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,754
I got another that you left
in my back 20 years ago.

472
00:16:39,837 --> 00:16:41,256
- [laughs]
- Could have seen that coming.

473
00:16:41,338 --> 00:16:42,631
Who asks about utensils?

474
00:16:42,715 --> 00:16:43,841
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

475
00:16:43,925 --> 00:16:45,634
Nope. No, you are not.

476
00:16:45,718 --> 00:16:47,262
Uh.

477
00:16:47,344 --> 00:16:49,264
Oh. Ow. Almost.

478
00:16:49,346 --> 00:16:51,348
[exciting music]

479
00:16:51,432 --> 00:16:53,350
- Drive, drive, drive!
- Oh. Oh, no.

480
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:55,186
I can't turn the car around.

481
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,396
I've been trying to do this
three-point turn forever.

482
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:59,774
I mean, it's more like a 300-point turn.

483
00:16:59,857 --> 00:17:01,358
- Am I right, huh?
- Hee hee hee hee!

484
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:02,860
Hey, we've got two sacks

485
00:17:02,944 --> 00:17:04,653
of Kardashian swag and
the fuzz on our heels.

486
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:07,282
You think this is Driver's
Ed, you hat-wearing pussy?

487
00:17:07,364 --> 00:17:10,785
Drive the goddamn car!

488
00:17:10,868 --> 00:17:12,954
[coughs]

489
00:17:14,663 --> 00:17:15,664
Hey, Herb,

490
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:17,292
is that your Vitamix?

491
00:17:17,374 --> 00:17:18,584
BoJack has one, too.

492
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:20,044
I wonder if you guys have

493
00:17:20,128 --> 00:17:23,339
strong opinions about
it one way or the other.

494
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:25,133
Well, the stupid thing was like 600 bucks.

495
00:17:25,216 --> 00:17:27,218
I have used mine a grand
total of zero times.

496
00:17:27,302 --> 00:17:29,511
I got it a month before I
was diagnosed with cancer.

497
00:17:29,595 --> 00:17:31,306
I don't give a shit about
being healthy anymore.

498
00:17:31,388 --> 00:17:33,057
I don't even have cancer,
and I don't use it.

499
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:34,475
- So who's it for?
- Exactly.

500
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:36,352
What is so great about liquids?

501
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:39,480
Every article I read now is
"juice this" and "juice that."

502
00:17:39,563 --> 00:17:41,774
You know why? Juice controls the media.

503
00:17:41,857 --> 00:17:45,194
- Hey-ooh.
- [both laugh]

504
00:17:45,278 --> 00:17:47,071
Can't this thing go any faster?

505
00:17:47,155 --> 00:17:49,448
Uh, I'm going as fast as I can.

506
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:52,201
[tires squealing]

507
00:17:52,285 --> 00:17:53,786
Do you want me to get
out? Try to guide you?

508
00:17:53,869 --> 00:17:55,204
No, I think I'm almost there.

509
00:17:55,288 --> 00:17:56,580
You're doing a great job.

510
00:17:56,664 --> 00:17:58,791
Kenzie, stop talking to him.

511
00:17:58,874 --> 00:18:00,876
Why? He's being nice.

512
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,086
Remember the number one rule

513
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,712
of the Celebrity Stealing Club...

514
00:18:03,796 --> 00:18:05,631
- "No falling in love."
- Ugh.

515
00:18:05,714 --> 00:18:07,800
That's your rule for every club.

516
00:18:07,883 --> 00:18:09,677
It's a good rule.

517
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,846
Whoa. Whoa, guys.

518
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:14,223
I'm sensing a lot of hostility here.

519
00:18:14,307 --> 00:18:17,810
Maybe we should take our
masks off and actually talk.

520
00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:20,313
You want me to take my mask off? Fine.

521
00:18:20,396 --> 00:18:22,564
Happy? I took my mask off.

522
00:18:22,648 --> 00:18:24,066
Did you?

523
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,320
Because I think you're
still wearing a mask.

524
00:18:27,403 --> 00:18:29,905
[both] Oh.

525
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:32,367
Oh, my God, Herb, you
met President Clinton?

526
00:18:32,449 --> 00:18:33,868
Oh, yeah. Many times.

527
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:35,328
Did you think that I
spent the last 20 years

528
00:18:35,411 --> 00:18:37,246
on my couch just feeling sorry for myself?

529
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,415
I mean, I did do that,
but I also started...

530
00:18:39,498 --> 00:18:41,500
[coughs] a charity to bring clean water

531
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,460
to millions of children
in Sub-Saharan Africa.

532
00:18:43,544 --> 00:18:44,837
Oh, wow.

533
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,422
I presented at the Teen Choice Awards.

534
00:18:46,505 --> 00:18:48,341
Wait, is that Charlotte?

535
00:18:48,424 --> 00:18:49,633
Yeah, yeah. We kept in touch.

536
00:18:49,717 --> 00:18:51,260
You should actually give her a call.

537
00:18:51,344 --> 00:18:53,095
I'm sure she'd love to hear from you.

538
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:54,847
She looks good for someone so old.

539
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,098
She's three years younger than you.

540
00:18:56,182 --> 00:18:58,184
- Exactly!
- [laughs]

541
00:18:58,267 --> 00:19:00,019
- [coughs]
- Er?

542
00:19:00,102 --> 00:19:01,937
Well, guys, I'm pretty beat.

543
00:19:02,021 --> 00:19:03,314
I think I need to head off to bed,

544
00:19:03,398 --> 00:19:04,815
and I hope I actually wake up later.

545
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:06,859
[coughs]

546
00:19:06,942 --> 00:19:10,446
And it was actually
nice to see you, BoJack.

547
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:11,613
You can see yourselves out.

548
00:19:11,697 --> 00:19:13,366
[chuckling]

549
00:19:13,449 --> 00:19:15,368
"Juice controls the media."

550
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:18,120
[chuckling] I love it.

551
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,290
So I guess in a sense

552
00:19:21,374 --> 00:19:22,917
I'm running away from the cops,

553
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,170
but I feel like in another, truer sense,

554
00:19:26,254 --> 00:19:28,256
I'm running away from myself.

555
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:30,549
- Truth. Truth.
- Whoa.

556
00:19:30,632 --> 00:19:32,843
Kenzie, do you have anything to share?

557
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:34,803
Just how amazing it feels to finally

558
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:35,930
be honest for once.

559
00:19:36,013 --> 00:19:37,514
I could live a million lives,

560
00:19:37,598 --> 00:19:39,434
and I'd never forget this one afternoon.

561
00:19:39,516 --> 00:19:40,684
Word.

562
00:19:40,768 --> 00:19:41,977
You know, I act all cool

563
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:43,938
and sophisticated on the outside,

564
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:47,275
but on the inside, I'm just Todd, you know?

565
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:49,402
But thanks to you guys, I think I'm finally

566
00:19:49,485 --> 00:19:51,112
- ready to let my guard down.
- Do you hear that?

567
00:19:51,195 --> 00:19:53,281
- He's letting his guard down.
- Let's get him!

568
00:19:53,364 --> 00:19:54,782
- [grunts]
- Oh!

569
00:19:54,865 --> 00:19:57,118
[both] Celebrity Stealing
Club strikes again.

570
00:19:57,201 --> 00:20:00,496
[upbeat music]

571
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:05,042
This... This just doesn't feel right.

572
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:07,002
I should have brought a bottle of wine.

573
00:20:07,086 --> 00:20:09,213
That's what adults do. BoJack, damn it.

574
00:20:09,297 --> 00:20:10,839
Is that what's bothering you,

575
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:12,883
- that you didn't bring wine?
- You're right.

576
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:14,302
I just would have drunk it on the way here.

577
00:20:14,385 --> 00:20:16,262
This isn't about wine, BoJack.

578
00:20:16,345 --> 00:20:19,265
If you have something you
need to say to someone,

579
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:21,934
you should do it while you have the chance

580
00:20:22,017 --> 00:20:24,979
because before you know
it, it'll be too late.

581
00:20:25,104 --> 00:20:26,688
Is this one of those
things where we're talking

582
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:29,108
about Herb but we're actually
talking about something else?

583
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:31,986
- No, I was talking about Herb.
- Okay, good. Yeah, me, too.

584
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:34,655
[cheerfully] Hey, buddy!

585
00:20:34,738 --> 00:20:36,865
You come back for that Vitamix, you...

586
00:20:36,949 --> 00:20:38,993
[coughs]

587
00:20:39,076 --> 00:20:40,536
Ooh, you should get that looked at.

588
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:43,038
Yeah. I've been meaning to see a doctor.

589
00:20:43,122 --> 00:20:46,375
Hey, I wanted to talk
to you about... you know.

590
00:20:46,459 --> 00:20:51,005
I feel bad about what happened.

591
00:20:51,088 --> 00:20:53,174
So you're apologizing.

592
00:20:53,257 --> 00:20:55,468
Yes. I'm sorry.

593
00:20:55,551 --> 00:20:57,512
Okay. I don't forgive you.

594
00:20:57,594 --> 00:20:58,971
Herb, I said I'm sorry.

595
00:20:59,054 --> 00:21:01,765
Yeah, and I do not forgive you.

596
00:21:01,849 --> 00:21:04,810
Uh... not sure you get
what's happening here.

597
00:21:04,893 --> 00:21:06,979
This could be the last time that you...

598
00:21:07,104 --> 00:21:09,398
No. I'm not gonna give you closure.

599
00:21:09,482 --> 00:21:10,858
You don't get that.

600
00:21:10,941 --> 00:21:12,527
[coughs] You have to live

601
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:14,111
with the shitty thing you did

602
00:21:14,195 --> 00:21:15,530
for the rest of your life.

603
00:21:15,612 --> 00:21:17,406
You have to know that it's never,

604
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,949
ever going to be okay.

605
00:21:19,033 --> 00:21:21,035
I really think that we'd both

606
00:21:21,118 --> 00:21:22,661
- feel better if we just...
- I'm dying.

607
00:21:22,744 --> 00:21:24,372
I'm not gonna feel better,

608
00:21:24,455 --> 00:21:26,665
and I'm not gonna be your
prop so you can feel better.

609
00:21:26,748 --> 00:21:28,501
You have to believe me.

610
00:21:28,584 --> 00:21:30,127
- I did everything I could.
- Yeah?

611
00:21:30,211 --> 00:21:32,254
Then why didn't you call me? Huh?

612
00:21:32,338 --> 00:21:34,673
20 years... You didn't call me.

613
00:21:34,756 --> 00:21:37,259
Look, I... I wanted to,
but I didn't think...

614
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:38,553
You know what it was like for me?

615
00:21:38,635 --> 00:21:40,762
I had nobody. Everybody left.

616
00:21:40,846 --> 00:21:42,557
I knew all those showbiz
phonies would turn on me.

617
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:43,974
Sure. But you?

618
00:21:44,058 --> 00:21:45,642
It's not my fault you got fired.

619
00:21:45,726 --> 00:21:47,728
I don't care about the job!

620
00:21:47,811 --> 00:21:50,898
I did fine. I had a good life.

621
00:21:50,981 --> 00:21:53,025
But what I needed then was a friend,

622
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:55,194
and you abandoned me.

623
00:21:55,277 --> 00:21:58,531
And I will never forgive you for that.

624
00:21:58,614 --> 00:22:02,201
Now, get the fuck out of my house.

625
00:22:02,284 --> 00:22:03,911
I...

626
00:22:03,994 --> 00:22:05,580
[sighs]

627
00:22:08,082 --> 00:22:09,791
Hey, this is a dumb
question, but the gay thing

628
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,419
and the rectal cancer thing
aren't related, are they?

629
00:22:11,502 --> 00:22:12,753
- Get out of here!
- Never mind.

630
00:22:12,836 --> 00:22:15,047
Stupid question. Forget I brought it up.

631
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,592
- Huh.
- Hey, BJ.

632
00:22:17,674 --> 00:22:20,094
- Put that back, asshole!
- No, you gave this to me.

633
00:22:20,177 --> 00:22:21,303
- [growls]
- No!

634
00:22:21,387 --> 00:22:23,889
[both grunting]

635
00:22:23,972 --> 00:22:25,516
[Diane] BoJack?

636
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,352
What are you doing? Get off him.

637
00:22:28,436 --> 00:22:30,687
The show was never the
same after I left. Admit it.

638
00:22:30,812 --> 00:22:33,107
Some people prefer the later years.

639
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:37,152
- [growling]
- BoJack. Come on.

640
00:22:37,236 --> 00:22:39,780
- [panting]
- Thank you for inviting us.

641
00:22:39,863 --> 00:22:41,949
You have a lovely home.

642
00:22:42,032 --> 00:22:43,492
You know what your problem is?

643
00:22:43,576 --> 00:22:45,827
You want to think of
yourself as the good guy.

644
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:47,788
Well, I know you better than anyone,

645
00:22:47,871 --> 00:22:50,124
and I can tell you that you're not.

646
00:22:50,207 --> 00:22:53,419
In fact, you'd probably
sleep a lot better at night

647
00:22:53,502 --> 00:22:55,212
if you just admitted to yourself

648
00:22:55,296 --> 00:22:57,548
that you're a selfish goddamn coward

649
00:22:57,632 --> 00:23:00,509
who takes whatever he wants
and doesn't give a shit

650
00:23:00,593 --> 00:23:02,010
about who he hurts.

651
00:23:02,094 --> 00:23:05,347
That's you. That's BoJack Horseman.

652
00:23:05,431 --> 00:23:08,601
I don't know why I came here.

653
00:23:08,684 --> 00:23:12,187
Yeah. You do.

654
00:23:12,271 --> 00:23:14,189
[engine revs, tires screech]

655
00:23:14,273 --> 00:23:16,525
[Princess Carolyn] You
said you wanted a job.

656
00:23:16,609 --> 00:23:19,528
It doesn't matter. Nothing matters.

657
00:23:19,612 --> 00:23:21,614
Wow. What happened in Malibu?

658
00:23:21,697 --> 00:23:23,824
- I gotta go.
- [phone beeps]

659
00:23:23,907 --> 00:23:25,951
Hey, bright side.

660
00:23:26,034 --> 00:23:27,953
At least now you have a good story to tell

661
00:23:28,036 --> 00:23:29,997
at his funeral.

662
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,082
Ugh, God.

663
00:23:43,802 --> 00:23:46,054
I'm not trying to kill the vibe here,

664
00:23:46,138 --> 00:23:48,683
but I've had to pee for, like, three hours.

665
00:23:48,765 --> 00:23:50,392
[sighs]

666
00:23:50,476 --> 00:23:51,977
Look, I won't put what happened today

667
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,729
in the book if you don't want me to.

668
00:23:53,812 --> 00:23:55,147
No, it's okay.

669
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,232
Full truth like we agreed.

670
00:23:57,316 --> 00:23:58,400
Warts and all.

671
00:23:58,484 --> 00:23:59,943
It doesn't matter anyway.

672
00:24:00,027 --> 00:24:02,112
I don't even care what
anybody thinks anymore.

673
00:24:02,196 --> 00:24:03,656
Well, for what it's worth,

674
00:24:03,739 --> 00:24:05,199
I think it took a lot of guts

675
00:24:05,282 --> 00:24:06,701
to do what you did back there.

676

[water lapping]

677
00:24:09,453 --> 00:24:10,705

- Mm!
