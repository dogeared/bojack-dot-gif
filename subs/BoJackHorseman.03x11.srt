1
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,184
Good morning, morning.

2
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:23,065
Good morning, sun. Good morning, trees.

3
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,651
Good morning, busy buzzy bees.

4
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,071
Good morning, Sarah Lynn. Good
to see you, Sarah Lynn.

5
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,281
The tulips and
chrysanthemums are really coming in.

6
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,700
Good morning, handsome garden ants.

7
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,036
I like the way you plant my plants.

8
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,859
Your flowers make my feelings

9
00:00:37,884 --> 00:00:40,523
dance. I like your
handsome planter pants.

10
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,544
Goddamn it! Why won't you...?

11
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:46,964
It's okay.

12
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,967
Sarah Lynn, you are calm, you are thin.

13
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,263
Your skin is so soft, it's like
you murdered a baby and stole its skin.

14
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,932
Your skin is "murdered-baby" soft.

15
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,725
Okay.

16
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,688
Blueberry, goji berry, flax,

17
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:06,525
chia, shark fin,
and... white rhino horn.

18
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:15,492
Sober, so good.

19
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,077
Oh.

20
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,037
- BoJack?
- Hey, Sarah Lynn.

21
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:21,957
- You wanna party?
- Oh, thank God. Yes!

22
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:18,253

23
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,561
Okay, hand me the açai.

24
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,104
- Is that how you pronounce it?
- Who knows?

25
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,004
They should really just
call them "overpriced

26
00:02:28,029 --> 00:02:29,173
blueberries for douchebags."

27
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,567
- Ow.
- How's life?

28
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:31,958
Well, the truth is that...

29
00:02:31,983 --> 00:02:34,345
Didn't catch that,
but everything's cool?

30
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,198
No. In fact, I've never felt so alone...

31
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,909
Sorry, missed it! You should
learn to talk louder, dude!

32
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,411
Oh, hey, bummer about
you getting the nomination,

33
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,872
but then, it turning out that
you didn't get the nomination.

34
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:44,998
It was big news yesterday.

35
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,242
Yeah, I got royally screwed,
know who was there for me?

36
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,587
No one, because everyone's an
asshole and the whole world sucks balls.

37
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,256
- Anyway, thanks for having me over.
- I'm with you, man.

38
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,844
Everything sucks! Especially sobriety.
Why would I make my body a temple?

39
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,472
I've been to Temple. Temple
is super boring.

40
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,808
What do you say we go on an epic bender?

41
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,936
Yes! Let's get higher than
a stilt walker's dick!

42
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,688
That's what I'm talking about.
Let's get some booze and drugs.

43
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:11,372
We can clear out my bank
account. I got nothing left I care about.

44
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,319
What do you mean "get"? This
whole house is booze and drugs.

45
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,279
- Here. -
Yogurt-covered raisins?

46
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,116
- Nope. Vicodin-covered
Vicodin. - Oh!

47
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,118
- LSD.
- Wow.

48
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,370
- Yah! Crystal
meth. - Ha-ha!

49
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,622
Ee-yah!

50
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,291
Cocaine... No! That's drywall.

51
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,877
Ugh! Where the hell did
I hide the cocaine?

52
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,172
Oh, yeah, I also told the
liquor store to deliver.

53
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,717
To nine months of sobriety.

54
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,969
To life and being done with it!

55
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,307
Okay, okay. What about this one?

56
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,351
Remember when Erika Eleniak

57
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,812
guest starred as Goober's
cousin from out of town,

58
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,523
and Brad had a boner
for the whole episode?

59
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:55,068
- What? No.
- You can totally see it in every scene.

60
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,279
Cold open, boner! Act one, boner!

61
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,009
Commercial break... "Hello, we're from

62
00:03:59,034 --> 00:04:00,848
the Wheaties corporation!"
Back to boners!

63
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,535
Okay, we'll put it on the
list. We gotta watch that one.

64
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,928
What about the one where the

65
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,104
writers made Joelle dress
up like a pumpkin,

66
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,032
and the whole episode
was fat jokes,

67
00:04:09,057 --> 00:04:11,025
so then Joelle got
an eating disorder?

68
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,724
Everything was so
much simpler back then.

69
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,672
She had to go to a clinic. She
missed, like, five episodes.

70
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,424
We didn't know how good we had it.

71
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,010
We got to come to work
and have fun every day,

72
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,804
and we weren't worried about
our legacy or awards.

73
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:26,308
Because buildings are
supposed to be rectangles, goddamn it!

74
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,351
Wait, what were we talking about?

75
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,187
<i>We were talking about Horsin' Around.</i>

76
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,313
Then, you had to go pee.

77
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,315
Then, you came back covered
in toilet paper

78
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,566
and pretended to be a mummy.

79
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,611
Then, you took it all off because
you decided Egypt was stupid,

80
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,862
especially pyramids,

81
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,059
because you think
triangle buildings

82
00:04:41,084 --> 00:04:43,140
are, and I quote,
"gauche as shit."

83
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,577
That does sound like me, but
I don't remember any of that.

84
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,220
I must have blacked out. Maybe I
should lay off the alcohol for...

85
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:52,167
and I said, "You're sitting
on the pizza, Mr. President."

86
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,004
- Whoa! I think I just had another one.
- Another what? Pizza?

87
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:59,508
No, blackout. The thing we
were just talking about.

88
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,551
- Try to keep up here.
- Oh...

89
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,929
Boom! Boner! Pay
up! What did I tell you?

90
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,806
That's not a boner. It's a shadow.

91
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,350
Well, I think we all learned
a valuable lesson today

92
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,143
about the Armenian genocide.

93
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:13,897
The Armenian genocide was too much, man!

94
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,943
All right! Next episode.

95
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,654
Why can't life be like
it was on Horsin' Around?

96
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:24,241
All our issues conveniently
settled in 22 hilarious minutes.

97
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,494
You know, it's amazing that
it's legal for kids to be actors.

98
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,664
How is that not child labor? I
didn't know what I was signing up for.

99
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,707
- I was three.
- This is getting me depressed.

100
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:33,792
Let's do something fun.

101
00:05:33,817 --> 00:05:35,860
Oh! Okay, you know
what really kicks ass?

102
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,212
The planetarium!

103
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,422
You get crazy high in the parking lot,

104
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,227
then you go in and get your mind

105
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:43,617
blown by all the trippy
galaxies and shit.

106
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,971
That sounds stupid. I'm
gonna be in charge of the fun.

107
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,889
No, no, no! That was drywall.

108
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,141
Jesus, we have to start marking
our drugs more clearly.

109
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,509
Let's just take a box of whiskey and go.

110
00:05:52,534 --> 00:05:53,294
Whoo!

111
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,522
- It was just so hard.
- Wha...? What the...?

112
00:05:55,605 --> 00:06:00,235
I was stuck in a terrifying
cycle of drinking, lifting my head up,

113
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:04,072
drinking, lifting my head
up, drinking, lifting my head up.

114
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,658
Coffee, stale donuts,
attention hogs telling

115
00:06:06,683 --> 00:06:08,517
boring stories about themselves?

116
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,705
- Jesus! Are we at a 12-step
meeting? - Now, you're a detective?

117
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,948
Last night, you couldn't even

118
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,648
solve the mystery of
where the toilet is.

119
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,793
So, all our partying
was an elaborate trick

120
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,003
just to get me to go sober?

121
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,380
No, Detective Pukes in
the Washing Machine.

122
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,841
You're here because I couldn't
leave you alone in my house,

123
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:23,925
and I had to come today.

124
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,302
Gotta get my nine-month chip.

125
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,054
Chip? We've been wasted for... 31 hours?

126
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,889
That's no reason for
me to not get my chip.

127
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,493
That's literally exactly the
reason you shouldn't get your chip.

128
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,811
Nowhere in the 12 steps
does it say to not drink.

129
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,606
That's not actually one
of the steps. Loophole.

130
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,441
Take a swig.

131
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,764
If you have to listen to losers

132
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,259
talk about their shitty sober lives,

133
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,112
it's a lot more fun to be buzzed.

134
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:48,116
And I realized people don't
change because they want to change.

135
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,202
They change because they have to change.

136
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,163
Oh, God. Boo!

137
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,749
Oh, booing is
generally frowned upon here.

138
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,501
How else am I supposed to
express how boring these stories are?

139
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:03,214
My name is
Simon and I'm an alcoholic.

140
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,758
Hi, Simon.

141
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:10,055
My rock bottom was when I
actually woke up under a rock.

142
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,223
Can't get lower than that.

143
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,517
Come on! You people
call yourself drunks?

144
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,479
Most of this is stuff I do on
a daily basis completely sober.

145
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,940
Trust me, pal, we've
done some awful things.

146
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,983
One time, I didn't
want my friend to move out,

147
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,962
so I used character actress Ann

148
00:07:23,987 --> 00:07:26,553
Dowd to help me sabotage
his hip-hopera.

149
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,031
Oh, please, that's baby stuff.

150
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,242
You so-called drunks want something
to feel shitty about?

151
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:34,371
- BoJack, maybe we should go.
- I got somethin' for ya. Whoa.

152
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,789
My name is BoJack.

153
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,374
Hi, BoJack.

154
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,917
Oh, like you didn't know?

155
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,795
Anyway, I once went all the way down to

156
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,569
New Mexico to see a
woman that I knew,

157
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,464
and she had a young daughter, Penny.

158
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,707
Penny Carson. That's her real

159
00:07:45,714 --> 00:07:47,366
name. You can look her up.
I don't care.

160
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,220
And first, I tried to sleep with
the mom, but she said no.

161
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,263
Then, I tried to sleep with the daughter.

162
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,975
Then, the mom walked in on me trying
to sleep with the daughter,

163
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:58,311
and I was like, "Oopsie-doopsie!
Exit stage right!"

164
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,437
Oh, God.

165
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,357
The worst part is, I don't even
know what happened after I left.

166
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,735
Did I ruin the family? Did I
scar that little girl for life?

167
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,195
I don't know. I'll never know.

168
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,572
And that's just, like,
one of a billion things

169
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,200
that I have going through
my head all the time.

170
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,160
So, anyone got a better story than that?

171
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,453
Wow.

172
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:16,997
Didn't think so, bitches.

173
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,832
Where's my trophy, or chip, or whatever?

174
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:21,793
Whoa!

175
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,338
That was impressive, BoJack.

176
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,280
I've never seen them
cancel an AA meeting

177
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:29,074
because everyone got
bummed out before.

178
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,176
Uh, what are you talking about?

179
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,554
You told everyone
about that Penny chick.

180
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,556
Then, you went on and on about
how you're never going to change.

181
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,439
Then, you chased the slug around,
threatening to pour salt on his head.

182
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,612
I talked about Penny?

183
00:08:38,637 --> 00:08:41,128
Hey! We've all done
shitty stuff before.

184
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,607
Most of us aren't as proud
of it as you seem to be.

185
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:48,778
I'm not proud. I feel really terrible
that I might have really messed that girl up.

186
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,239
Oh, she's fine. I looked
her up on Facebook.

187
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,323
She's going to Oberlin,

188
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,195
likes Thai food and
the smell of a

189
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,518
fire on the first really
cold day of winter.

190
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,371
That doesn't mean anything. Everyone
likes the smell of fire

191
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,456
on the first cold day of winter.

192
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,206
You know, I used to
feel just like you

193
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:02,983
before I got into this
"12 steps" thing.

194
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,502
They taught me how to make amends.

195
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,466
You just say you're
sorry for the things you did

196
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,797
and you get a clean slate.

197
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,764
So, what? Just dirty up the slate again.

198
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:11,533
Then, you just make amends again.

199
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:12,927
It's a never-ending cycle,

200
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,597
where you always end up feeling
good about yourself.

201
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,806
- No!
- You know what?

202
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,225
This may be the
nitrous and bath salts talking,

203
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,269
but I want to do some
more nitrous and bath salts.

204
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,230
And then, let's
make some goddamn amends.

205
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,908
Maybe you should start with the

206
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:28,092
family whose playhouse
you just smashed.

207
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,652
- Oh, no!
- Oh. Hey, kid!

208
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,655
I'm sorry your lame dad
built such a cheap-ass playhouse!

209
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,687
Yeah, you gotta use
parallel joints

210
00:09:34,712 --> 00:09:36,767
to support that
foundation, dumbshit!

211
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:40,246
- Also, suck a dick!
- You know what? I do feel better.

212
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,421
- I don't think they're home.
- So, we wait.

213
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,757
I need to make amends to Diane,
and we're not leaving until I do.

214
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,470
But it's boring out
here, and I'm hungry and I'm bored!

215
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,971
I bet they have food inside.

216
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,682
Let's see if I still have
that spare key. Here it is.

217
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,934
Yes!

218
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,143
Okay, after we get food,

219
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,854
remind me that this is another
thing I need to make amends for.

220
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,608
Where are those two?

221
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,568
They did not keep their
fridge stocked enough

222
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,612
for two stoned people waiting
around for hours.

223
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,824
It's only been, like, ten
minutes. You have a real thing with food.

224
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,159
That's what happens when you
mix the appetite of a horse

225
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,078
with the appetite of
someone with a hole inside him

226
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,721
that needs to be constantly
filled with attention, food, and sex.

227
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,125
- Pass the Bugles.
- There's no more Bugles.

228
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,960
There's no more of
anything. Let's just go.

229
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:31,339
- I can't leave until I make amends.
-  I got a idea!

230
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:35,677
My name is BoJack's friend
What's-Her-Face and I wear glasses.

231
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,595
Do you have
something to say to me, BoJack?

232
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,849
- Am I BoJack or Mr. Peanutbutter?
- You can be anyone you want.

233
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:44,018
This is your dream... dream... dream...

234
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,980
Stop doing that. We're both
awake. Let's just get to this.

235
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,274
Diane, I'm sorry I
said mean things to you.

236
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,902
That's cool. I forgive you. Wait,
would my character say that?

237
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,864
What's Diane's deal again?
She's, like, an Asian Daria?

238
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:59,784
- She's a little more complex.
- But she's basically Asian Daria, right?

239
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:03,329
With the glasses and the
jacket and her whole "blah" thing.

240
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,582
Okay, shut up. Now,
I'll be Mr. Peanutbutter

241
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,916
and you make amends to me.

242
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,334
Who's Mr. Peanutbutter?

243
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,171
And, now, you be Mr.
Carolyn and I'll be Princess Diana.

244
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,339
Oh, yeah. Good idea.

245
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,259
Um... should we do something about this?

246
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,471
Hey, why don't you two sleep
this off in our guest room?

247
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,348
Oh, my God, that
mirror is talking to us!

248
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,601
You can't stop us, us from the future!

249
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,769
We're making amends, assholes!

250
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,689
Ow! Come on!

251
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,276
- That felt so good!
- See?

252
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,695
When you make amends, don't
you just feel lighter?

253
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,697
Well, I also ate a shit
ton of Bugles, so no.

254
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,025
But I do feel like we got to the

255
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,660
bottom of who really
killed Princess Di.

256
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,786
- It was all of us.
- Next stop, Todd!

257
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,957
Todd, I'm sorry. I want to take full
responsibility for what happened,

258
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,960
even though it is not my
fault and I did nothing wrong.

259
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,546
Emily is an adult woman who
can make her own choices.

260
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,882
And besides, are you
even really into girls?

261
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,092
- I mean, what is your deal?
- Uh...

262
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,802
- Hey, what are you doing with our son?
- Uh...

263
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,095
Wait, you're BoJack Horseman.

264
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:04,641
I am, and this is my
best buddy Todd.

265
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,685
That movie star has
really taken a shine to our boy.

266
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:08,937
You think this is our big break?

267
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,065
You don't think he's
inappropriately interested, do you?

268
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,109
What? No. But if he is, that
could also be a big break.

269
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,194
I'm just saying.

270
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,419
- Hey, wait!
- Hold on. Where are you going?

271
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,783
- Come back.
- You want to take Todd for a sleepover?

272
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,117
- Sleepover?
- No offense, Todd,

273
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,681
but your parents are creeping me out.

274
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,412
To the next amends!

275
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,252
- What do you want, BoJack?
- I don't know.

276
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,088
I'm very drunk and a little nauseous,

277
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,924
but if I'm here in your
house, it must be to make amends.

278
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,426
- Amends... for what?
- I don't know.

279
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,804
Whatever it is that you think
I did to make you disappear.

280
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,389
- BoJack...
- How could you leave me like that

281
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,473
when I needed you most?

282
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:48,935
I'm sorry, BoJack. I thought you
were a winner. I was wrong.

283
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,521
This is hard for me,
too. I staked my reputation...

284
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,981
No, this is not about
the Oscar campaign.

285
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,024
How could you think that this
is about the Oscar campaign?

286
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,651
We had something more, didn't we?

287
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,320
- You've been drinking.
- Well, not just drinking.

288
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,031
Yes, Ana, I'm a mess.

289
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,284
Whoa! I am a broken,
screwed-up misfit toy,

290
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,787
and you act all in control,

291
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,832
but I know that, deep
down, you're broken, too.

292
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,210
And I don't know why
you won't just give

293
00:13:13,235 --> 00:13:15,193
us a chance to be
broken together.

294
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,879
What about that doesn't appeal to you?

295
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:23,720
BoJack, when I was in
college, I had a job as a lifeguard...

296
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,390
Wait, did we just go to Ana's
house? Did I get closure?

297
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,768
If by "closure" you mean I lit
her ottoman on fire, then yes.

298
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,020
We gotta go back.

299
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,063
- What the hell?
- I know I was just here,

300
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,190
but I feel like you told
me some important story

301
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,817
that explained everything about us.

302
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,403
Unfortunately, I totally spaced it.

303
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,238
Gotta be honest. I've
had a couple beers.

304
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:46,534
Ugh! All right, I'll tell you
again, if it'll make you leave.

305
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,327
When I was a lifeguard, I...

306
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:51,414
- Oh, crud.
- You want to go back to Ana's, don't you?

307
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,875
I feel like I'll
definitely get it this time.

308
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,668
Lifeguard...

309
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,671
- One more time?
- No. This time I wrote it down.

310
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:03,134
"I'm a lifeguard. This woman's
house smells weird, or is that me?

311
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,469
Pay attention, Sarah Lynn.

312
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,672
Don't do that thing where
you write down your thoughts

313
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,639
instead of what the
person is actually saying.

314
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:11,392
I wonder if it's time to
get my boobs done again."

315
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,036
- Mm-hmm.
-  That's very helpful.

316
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,270
Thank you. Who's next?

317
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,272
I'm sorry!

318
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,900
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

319
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,487
I'm sorry!

320
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,622
Okay, so I know I keep
bothering you tonight.

321
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,416
Tonight? I haven't
seen you in two weeks.

322
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,334
Oh, really?

323
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,462
I just need to know what you were trying
to tell me about being a lifeguard,

324
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,714
and then, I'll leave and
you'll never see me again.

325
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,257
Mmm...

326
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,238
After I almost
drowned, I decided I

327
00:14:45,263 --> 00:14:47,369
would never again be
weaker than water.

328
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,430
So, I became a lifeguard.

329
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,225
On my first day of
training, my instructor told me

330
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:56,187
that there are going to be times when
you'll see someone in trouble.

331
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,580
You're going to want to rush in

332
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,506
there and do whatever
you can to save them,

333
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,151
but you have to stop yourself,

334
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,446
because there are some
people you can't save.

335
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,032
'Cause those people will
thrash and struggle

336
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:11,494
and try to take you down with them.

337
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,373
What does that have to do with me?

338
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,709
What the...? Where the hell are we now?

339
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,002
- Ohi...
- Ojai?

340
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,672
- We drove all the way to Ojai?
- Let me finish.

341
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,758
Ohi, and here's the kicker... O.

342
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,594
- Ohio.
- We drove all the way to Ohio?!

343
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:29,780
I wanted to go to the

344
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:32,164
planetarium, but you
demanded we come here.

345
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:36,060
You said you had to make one
more amend, to that Penny girl.

346
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,937
What? No! That is a terrible idea.

347
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,856
Let's turn this car around right now.

348
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,399
Uh...

349
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,776
- I feel we didn't turn the car around.
- No, we did,

350
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,653
but then, you turned it back around

351
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,197
because you really
wanted to find that deer girl,

352
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,199
so we decided to do a stakeout.

353
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,350
There was a whole makeover

354
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,893
sequence, where we went to the mall

355
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,620
and tried on different
trench coats for each other.

356
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,581
Do you not remember any of that?

357
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,333
This is insane. I already
scarred her for life.

358
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,337
If I see her again, I'll just end up
getting my horribleness all over her.

359
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,464
You think it's too late
for me to go to college?

360
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,007
I always wanted to be an architect.

361
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,383
But one of those architects,

362
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,552
where, at night, she's
a high-end call girl,

363
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,221
and, by day, she's an
international superspy.

364
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,475
- So, when is she an architect?
- I don't know. Frontier times?

365
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,934
No, I didn't mean what era.

366
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:19,562
If she's a call girl at
night and a spy during the day...

367
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,231
- Hey, look, Penny.
- Oh, God, what's she doing?

368
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,650
- Does she look emotionally damaged?
- She's just going to the computer.

369
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,528
She's probably in a sex chat
room with some middle-aged horse

370
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,323
because that's the only
way she can still feel love.

371
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,826
- Yeah, probably.
- Or she's so upset about what you did

372
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,746
that she's using the Internet
to find ways to commit suicide.

373
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,909
That makes even more sense.

374
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,750
All right, we've
established that you ruined her.

375
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,252
- Can we go back to L.A. now?
- Yes.

376
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,964
So... obviously, I wanted to keep
following Penny because I'm an idiot.

377
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,508
Let's just nip this in the bud.

378
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,135
I'm gonna write "Do not
follow Penny" on my hands

379
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,763
in the unlikely scenario
of my blacking out again.

380
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,390
I'll just write "Follow
Penny" on this hand,

381
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:57,975
and then, on this hand, I'll write...

382
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,353
- Goddamn it!
- What?

383
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,271
We're just doing what the hand said.

384
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,068
- Uh, what?
- The hand demanded donuts.

385
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,445
- There she is.
- She's drinking beer.

386
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,614
Oh, God, this is just like the
episode of Horsin' Around

387
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,157
when Olivia went to the frat party,

388
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:16,118
but Penny doesn't have a kind
angel played by Jose Canseco

389
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,745
to help her get out of this jam!

390
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,706
Ugh. Okay, now, I'm bored
again. Quit hoggin' the 'nocs.

391
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,793
She's just drinking Red
Bull. Wait. Now, she's leaving.

392
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,379
Hey, look, it's the Obertones!

393
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,005
Love your sound, dudes!

394
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,209
- ♪ Thank you ♪
- ♪ Thank you ♪

395
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,342
- ♪ Thank you ♪
- ♪ Thank you! ♪

396
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,886
She seems... fine.

397
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,557
Too fine, like she's hiding a dark
secret that's eating away at her soul.

398
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,268
Or, possibly... she's fine.

399
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,978
Maybe I didn't ruin her life.

400
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,855
Hey, you were a father figure, who
was sexually inappropriate to me,

401
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,148
and I turned out perfect.

402
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,442
- Now, can we please go home?
- Okay, good plan.

403
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,361
I'll just go pee out the last 20 beers.

404
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:52,679
Whoa. Look at
me, walking good.

405
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

406
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,493
No, no, no! Shush, shush.

407
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,579
- BoJack?
- Oh!

408
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:02,081
- What are you doing here?
- Hey, Penny!

409
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,334
- Did you come here to find me?
- No, I...

410
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,588
You can't be here. I-I
don't want to see you here.

411
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:12,466
I don't want to see you at all. I
was 17. I didn't know any better.

412
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,884
- I tried...
- You need to leave.

413
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,262
It's BoJack Horseman and Sarah Lynn!

414
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,149
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

415
00:18:17,174 --> 00:18:18,747
BoJack, we need to
get out of here now.

416
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,473
Can I get a selfie
and another selfie

417
00:18:20,498 --> 00:18:22,208
if the first selfie
doesn't look good?

418
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,937
BoJack, over here!

419
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,230
Penny, no.

420
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:27,898
Penny?

421
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,613
You know, on the plus
side, she really seemed okay.

422
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:34,530
Mm-hmm.

423
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,741
Until she saw you and freaked out.

424
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,655
But she probably would have been totally

425
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,018
fine if you'd never shown up.

426
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,289
- Oh, God.
- I think the wound was completely healed

427
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,417
before you reopened it by showing
up unannounced at her college

428
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,294
and all the pain
came rushing back to her.

429
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,295
Oh, good Lord!

430
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,714
In a way, it's like you
destroyed her life twice.

431
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,592
- Will you please stop talking about it?
- Okay, fine.

432
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,594
Whoop.

433
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,763
Man, Ohio sucks!

434
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,131
Next time, could you almost

435
00:19:00,156 --> 00:19:01,915
molest someone who
lives in Hawaii?

436
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,435
You could be bummed
out at a luau right now.

437
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,770
Let's just go home.

438
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,772
- You got a bottle opener?
- Glove compartment.

439
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:12,276
Well, I'll be a dick sucked by
a dumbshit! What do we have here?

440
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,029
Oh, that? Turns out there's a
brand of heroin called BoJack.

441
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,573
Dude, that's a big freaking deal.

442
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,660
Getting a drug named after you
is cooler than getting an Oscar.

443
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:23,245
I mean, there's Billy Crystal
Meth, Angel Dustin Hoffman,

444
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,997
Lucille Eightball and now you.

445
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,917
It's a rarefied breed,
man. Congratulations!

446
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,169
- Thank you?
- Oh, we have to do BoJack!

447
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,129
- It's too perfect.
- I don't know.

448
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,632
There's that old saying. "Liquor
before beer, never fear.

449
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:35,841
Don't do heroin."

450
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:38,511
"I'm BoJack. Please, put me inside you."

451
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,055
I'm not gonna shoot
heroin with you, Sarah Lynn.

452
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,808
We can snort heroin like
sophisticated adults.

453
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,226
Way ahead of you.

454
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:56,487
Okay, thank you. Happy
Thanksgiving 2007.

455
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,364
Why did you just say what year it is?

456
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,409
I guess I just get nervous talking
to network executives.

457
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:04,495
This last episode got
the worst ratings yet.

458
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:08,040
I was afraid your character trying
heroin would be a bridge too far.

459
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,626
- Oh.
- And the disjointed blackout structure,

460
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,921
with the one flashback in the middle,
really confused our audience.

461
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:14,839
Yeah.

462
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,550
They hated all the
fourth-wall-breaking meta jokes.

463
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:21,470
Of course. Audiences hate meta
jokes. When will comedy writers learn?

464
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,140
BoJack, I know there is an
audience out there for our show.

465
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,518
We just need to find a way to
get more people to check us out.

466
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,321
I know what you're
thinking... Full frontal.

467
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,647
I was thinking guest star.

468
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,567
We need a celebrity who is
incredibly popular right now, like...

469
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,611
- Oh, what about Sarah Lynn?
- Ooh, that's genius!

470
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,573
Sarah Lynn? I don't know. I
haven't spoken to her in years.

471
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,742
Besides, she's not
gonna want to do this.

472
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,785
She's the world's biggest pop star.

473
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,121
She's the only hope we
have to keep this show alive.

474
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,290
Would you ask her? I'm
sure she'd do it for you.

475
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,542
You're like a father to her.

476
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,341
- So, what is it?
- What is what?

477
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,303
You were mumbling about how
you had to ask me something.

478
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:06,348
Oh! Um, never mind. Hey, how
long have we known each other?

479
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,977
- Feels like our entire lives.
- Well, my entire life, pretty much.

480
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,730
We were on a TV show. Isn't that insane?

481
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,273
Yeah, it's pretty wild.

482
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,359
You know, sometimes it feels like you're
the only one who really understands me,

483
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,028
because how could anyone else?

484
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,278
Nobody knows what we went

485
00:21:20,303 --> 00:21:22,263
through, nobody who
wasn't on that show.

486
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,909
But we knew each other
before we were anybody,

487
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,812
and that's how we can
be friends, because

488
00:21:26,837 --> 00:21:28,353
we're not like those
other people.

489
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,165
The people who glom onto you because
of who they think you are,

490
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,498
and they think they can sleep on

491
00:21:32,523 --> 00:21:33,733
your couch and eat your food.

492
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,294
They think you're
gonna save their agency.

493
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,338
I never asked for that kind of pressure,

494
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,591
but you and me, we don't
want anything from each other.

495
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,886
You know, I... I could
never figure out what love meant,

496
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,639
but, right now, I don't
need to figure out anything.

497
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:50,476
I just feel it. I love you, Sarah Lynn.

498
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,853
Sarah Lynn?

499
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:54,814
- Sarah Lynn?
- What?

500
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:58,067
- Oh, my God! Thank God you're okay!
- I'm not okay. I'm bored.

501
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,985
This hotel room is boring!

502
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,237
What's on TV?

503
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,407
- The Oscars are on.
- Really?

504
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,953
- How long have we been on this bender?
- I love the Oscars.

505
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,163
The red carpet, the fashion,

506
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,750
all the magic of Hollywoo wrapped
up in one exciting night.

507
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,670
And the winner for
Best Original Song is...

508
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,297
"The Silly Banana Song (Love Theme)"

509
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,716
from The Nazi Who Played
Yahtzee by Sarah Lynn.

510
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,593
Get your ass up here, girl.

511
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:29,515
I won! Oh, my God!
I forgot I was even nominated.

512
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,518
I accept this on her behalf.

513
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,187
And if you're watching this, Sarah Lynn,

514
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:38,357
wherever you are, please come home.

515
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,446
Oh, man, I should have been there.

516
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,701
When I was a kid, if you'd
told me I'd win an Oscar,

517
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,536
I'd never have believed it.

518
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,913
And, now, I've done it and...

519
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:58,085
BoJack... I don't...

520
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,504
like anything about me.

521
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,339
- Hey.
- None of this is me.

522
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,008
These boobs aren't me.

523
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,802
- This house isn't me.
- We're not at your house right now.

524
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,554
The only reason I wear this shirt

525
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,932
is because some company paid
me $8,000 to wear it.

526
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:14,018
And I don't even need the money.

527
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,313
I just liked that someone
still wanted me to wear their shirt.

528
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,898
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

529
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,818
What am I supposed to
do? I don't know what to do.

530
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,738
Am I doomed? Are you
doomed? Are we all doomed?

531
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,324
No, no! Calm down. Nobody is doomed.

532
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,005
And I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

533
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,809
We're gonna go to the planetarium.

534
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,454
Really?

535
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,917
Our solar system formed about
four and a half billion years ago...

536
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,503
- Isn't this place amazing?
- Totally.

537
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:44,089
I always forget that there
are more than just the six stars

538
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,716
you can see in the Los Angeles sky.

539
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,260
Yeah, that's cool, too, but
I meant this building.

540
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:51,305
It's a giant dome. Domes are so cool.

541
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:54,475
I prefer rectangular
buildings, as I firmly established.

542
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,228
I wanna be an architect.

543
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:02,107
...be it horse,
cat, human, or even lizard,

544
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:04,693
our lives are but the briefest flashes

545
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:08,364
in a universe that is
billions of years old.

546
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,658
See, Sarah Lynn, we're not doomed.

547
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:14,411
In the great grand scheme of
things, we're just tiny specks

548
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:16,413
that will one day be forgotten.

549
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:18,246
So, it doesn't matter what we did in

550
00:24:18,271 --> 00:24:20,066
the past, or how
we'll be remembered.

551
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,671
The only thing that
matters is right now, this moment,

552
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:27,299
this one spectacular
moment we are sharing together.

553
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:28,717
Right, Sarah Lynn?

554
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:31,804
Sarah Lynn?

555
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,015
<i>Sarah Lynn?</i>

556
