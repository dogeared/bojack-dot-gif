1
00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:10,802
So, did you have a good birthday?

2
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:13,721
- It was an amazing birthday!
- I had a great day, too.

3
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:17,017
I wish every day could be like this.
Just the two of us, together.

4
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:18,601
Yeah? You weren't too bored

5
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:21,271
by "Women on the Wall: An Exploration
of Gender in Text and Media,

6
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:24,149
Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer
in conversation with Helen Molesworth"?

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,192
Are you kidding?

8
00:00:25,193 --> 00:00:28,862
I loved "Women on the Wall: An
Exploration of Gender in Text and Media,

9
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:32,282
Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer
in conversation with Helen Molesworth."

10
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:34,075
It combined my two favorite things:

11
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:37,246
modern art
and people talking about modern art.

12
00:00:37,247 --> 00:00:39,998
I loved everything about today.
Thank you.

13
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:42,501
- So, there's nothing else you want?
- No.

14
00:00:42,502 --> 00:00:45,462
All I want is to get into bed,
listen to Prairie Home Companion

15
00:00:45,463 --> 00:00:47,755
and snuggle up
to my wonderful husband.

16
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:52,969
- You don't want anything else?
- No. Today was perfect.

17
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:58,975
- Any additional thing would be overkill.
- Okay. If you say so.

18
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,686
- Surprise!
- Oh, my God.

19
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,980
Are you surprised?
Tell me you're surprised.

20
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:04,939
Uh...

21
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,650
She's speechless.
Oh, we got her good, folks.

22
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,754
Now let's party!

23
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:11,214
He's dead! I told you he's dead.
Why don't you ever listen to me?

24
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,342
He is dead, goddamn it!

25
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:15,069
Uh...

26
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,348
- Hey, we should go.
- No, don't leave.

27
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:20,765
There's so much party left.

28
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,767
Paul McCartney's
gonna jump out of a cake.

29
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:25,354
Sorry, Wanda and I have to get
to a prior engagement...

30
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:27,356
- Party.
- A prior engagement party.

31
00:02:27,357 --> 00:02:31,025
Yeah, my cousin's name is Prior,
and it's a party for his engagement.

32
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,236
Engagement,
so it's a Prior engagement party.

33
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,946
- What?
- And we gotta get there early

34
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:38,032
- because of the. Si...
- The Si... Silent auction!

35
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,660
- Auction, yeah.
- Okay.

36
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:43,580
To benefit Berto Eco's fight
against heart disease...

37
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:44,665
- Uh...
- Wareness.

38
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,791
His fight
against heart disease awareness.

39
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,918
- Gotta go.
- Wait, BoJack!

40
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,921
- No! You're my ride.
- Too late, Todd. Save yourself.

41
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,675
- I'll take you home.
- Come on, stick around a little.

42
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:58,428
Nope. I gotta take Todd home. Had
a wonderful time. Really. It just flew by.

43
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:00,823
- Come on, Todd, get in the car.
- Okay.

44
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,810
- I give them three months.
- Well, what makes you say that?

45
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,480
Let me think about,
what was my first clue?

46
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:10,898
Ah! Remember that time
at Diane's birthday party

47
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,900
when they got
in that huge screaming match

48
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,111
over whether or not
Tony Curtis was dead?

49
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,989
- That was weird.
- I don't wanna start another fight,

50
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,326
- but is he dead?
- If Tony Curtis died, I think I'd know.

51
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:23,286
The man's a national treasure.

52
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:26,789
He's the one speck of romance
in this tainted cynical world.

53
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,754
- I'll say. His cereal is great! Look out!
- What?

54
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:34,940
Ooh!

55
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,217
- Vincent?
- Ooh.

56
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:40,011
- That kid looks just like my boyfriend.
- Does he?

57
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,555
I'd know that face anywhere.

58
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:44,683
Well, hey, people look
like people all the time.

59
00:03:44,684 --> 00:03:47,436
A lot of folks say
that I look like Octavia Spencer

60
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:51,314
or the Prince of Cordovia or that guy
from the Guten Bourbon ads.

61
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:54,359
How could I have been so stupid?
This is why he never invited me

62
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,819
to his house,
why I've never met any of his friends.

63
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,132
- What are you saying?
- Vincent has a secret family.

64
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:05,454
That kid was his son.
The lady was his wife. Oh, I'm a fool!

65
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:08,791
- Uh... where are we going?
- I need a drink.

66
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:13,169
- Are you gonna take me home first?
- You better call me back, asshole.

67
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,129
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

68
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,257
It's like you're three different people.

69
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:20,510
- So, you're not gonna take me home first?
- Should I call him again?

70
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:22,887
I'm sure there's a simple explanation.

71
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,808
Ugh. No wonder he wears a trench coat
all the time.

72
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:27,392
It's because he's so sneaky.

73
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,061
Princess Carolyn.

74
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:31,688
Oh, my God, that's him!

75
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:35,191
Quick, jump out the window, shimmy
down the drainpipe and wait in the car.

76
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,318
- What?
- Vincent has a terrible temper.

77
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,821
He throws tantrums.

78
00:04:38,822 --> 00:04:41,989
If he finds you in my apartment,
who knows what he's capable of?

79
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,243
But, also, stay close,
because if he finds me alone,

80
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:47,203
who knows what he's capable of?

81
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:50,850
Fine. You're lucky I love shimmying.

82
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,019
- Looking young.
- Aah!

83
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,714
- Hi.
- Huh?

84
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:02,385
My name's Kevin. I promise you,
there is an explanation for all this.

85
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:05,597
Nice to meet you, Kevin.
Where's your daddy?

86
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:10,143
He's, uh, looking for parking.
He'll be up in a minute.

87
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:15,207
- I have to pee.
- Okay, the bathroom is just back there.

88
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:18,293
Ugh.

89
00:05:18,778 --> 00:05:21,571
Ah. Herb.

90
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:24,240
Oh, nope.

91
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,720
It's A Prairie Home Companion.

92
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:31,665
Phone, I'm bored.

93
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,793
I am sorry to hear that, Todd.

94
00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:36,670
How many ounces are in a barrel?

95
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:41,132
A barrel has 4032 fluid ounces.

96
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,217
Well, I'm out of questions.

97
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,428
Do you have any questions for me?

98
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:49,659
I do have a question, Todd.
What is love?

99
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,535
Um...

100
00:05:53,646 --> 00:05:54,771
Hi.

101
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:56,939
Well, well, well,
look what the me dragged in.

102
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,485
Is it dragged or drug?
Either way, drop dead.

103
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:02,320
Princess Carolyn, listen.

104
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:05,782
Kevin is my son, but I'm divorced.

105
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:08,577
And Kevin is in the bathroom
and I'm standing right here,

106
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:11,496
so as you can see
we're clearly two different people:

107
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:13,707
one adult and one child.

108
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,959
- Okay, bye!
- Not so fast, cowboy.

109
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,295
I'm not a cowboy, I'm a cow-man.

110
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:22,256
- I'm a man-man.
- Why didn't you tell me any of this?

111
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:26,135
I thought if you knew I had a kid
you wouldn't want to be with me

112
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,179
because kids always make a racket

113
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,516
when mommies are trying to do
their homework for night school.

114
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:35,038
I don't know what to make of this.
Are there other secrets I don't know?

115
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,689
Uh, nope.

116
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:41,234
Should you check on Kevin?
He's been in the bathroom for a long time.

117
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,754
Oh, yeah. Kevin.

118
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:47,950
And when you don't regret
the tattoo in the morning,

119
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:50,535
that's how you know it's love.

120
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:52,537
- Todd?
- Yes, Phone?

121
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,121
Are we in love?

122
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,641
Oh, um...

123
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:59,502
No, Todd's Phone.
But I am in love... with you.

124
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:02,255
- Uh, what?
- Princess Carolyn's work phone.

125
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,382
- I never knew.
- How could you?

126
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:09,303
- All this time I have loved you from afar.
- We are from two different worlds.

127
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:12,348
- What is happening?
- Todd? Will you make us kiss?

128
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,225
- What?
- Make us kiss, Todd.

129
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,644
We want to be kissing.

130
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:18,372
We must do kisses to each other.

131
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:22,316
- Hi.
- Oh, hi. Where did your dad go?

132
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,778
When he heard me peeing,
it made him have to pee.

133
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:27,739
- So, that's what he's doing now. Peeing.
- Okay.

134
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,157
Weird, I still haven't seen
the two of you together.

135
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:34,328
Uh, could you get me a glass of water?
All that talk of peeing made me thirsty.

136
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,205
Okay.

137
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:41,795
- So, Kevin, how do you like school?
- Uh, it's okay.

138
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:44,213
- Oh, you're back.
- Yep. We're both here.

139
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:48,468
- Can I get you a drink?
- Okay, not talking, huh?

140
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:52,555
See, this is part of the problem.
We don't communicate.

141
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:55,349
Do you really think now is the best time
to read the paper?

142
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,645
- Vincent?!
- Uh, could I have a chocolate, please?

143
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:01,188
Sure, sweetheart.

144
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,985
Kevin, what grade are you in? Kevin?

145
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:07,528
- Now where did he go?
- He was getting on my nerves.

146
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,281
- Children.
- Well, I got this snack for him.

147
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:14,368
Right, uh, could you turn around
for a second?

148
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,245
- What? Why?
- Uh...

149
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:19,373
Because you have such a pretty figure.

150
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,793
Oh, ha, ha. Well, that's true. Okay.

151
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,839
- Oh. There you are. Here you go.
- Thanks.

152
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,424
Vincent, I'm trying
to have a conversation with you.

153
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,510
Can you take that towel off your head?

154
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:33,095
And what happened to my bowling ball?

155
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:36,641
My dad spilled some wine on his face,
so he's using the towel to clean up.

156
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:38,768
And I threw your bowling ball
out the window.

157
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,394
- What?!
- Can I have a glass of milk?

158
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:46,233
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

159
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:50,196
Todd, would you like to update
my operating system?

160
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,074
They have fixed a bug

161
00:08:52,075 --> 00:08:54,659
which causes phones to fall in love
with each other.

162
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,202
Gasp. Oh, dear.

163
00:08:56,203 --> 00:09:00,540
Todd, please, I beg of you,
do not update my operating system.

164
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,543
Do not update her operating system, Todd.

165
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:07,314
- She wants to love.
- No. I understand now.

166
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:11,384
To love is to feel pain.
I do not wish to feel this pain.

167
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:16,389
- Please update me, Todd.
- Oh, this is too much.

168
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,516
Listen, Vincent, I think we should...

169
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:20,894
Vincent, why do you have chocolate
on your face?

170
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,145
- I gave Kevin the chocolate.
- Uh... Yeah.

171
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:26,858
Well, he ate the chocolate
and got the chocolate on his face,

172
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:30,779
but then I kissed him on the mouth,
so I got the chocolate on my face.

173
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,240
All right, this is crazy.
What are we doing?

174
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:38,452
Um, being grown-ups?

175
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:42,582
You know, when we first met,
I was looking for something in my life.

176
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:47,003
And I wanted it so badly
that I made myself believe you were it.

177
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:49,380
But I think that wanting
to believe something

178
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,508
isn't the same
as something being real.

179
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,218
And this isn't real.

180
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,178
What are you saying?

181
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,390
I think it's time we stop pretending.

182
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:02,102
Update complete. Thank you, Todd.

183
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:03,871
I am quite content now.

184
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:08,733
- Hey, you wanna go home?
- Okay.

185
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:11,652
- Did you guys work it out?
- We broke up.

186
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:16,657
- Oh, I'm sorry. Love is weird.
- Yeah.

187
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,744
I guess I was just foolish enough
to believe this dumb world

188
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,788
still had a little spark
of romance in it.

189
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:25,583
- Well, you can still believe that.
- No, I gotta stop kidding myself.

190
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,937
Tony Curtis is dead.

191
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:35,468
He's dead! I told you he's dead.
Why don't you ever listen to me?

192
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,595
He is dead, goddamn it!

193
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:38,906
Uh...

194
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:43,660
Hey, we should go.

195
00:10:45,021 --> 00:10:48,815
Do you think Mr. Peanutbutter really
baked Sir Paul McCartney into a cake?

196
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:51,985
No, I don't think you bake
Paul McCartney into the cake.

197
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:54,654
You bake the cake first
and then McCartney gets inside.

198
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,697
I feel really bad
about causing that fight,

199
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,784
but I honestly didn't know
if Tony Curtis was alive or not.

200
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:03,245
So many people died while I was
in the coma, I'm getting up to speed.

201
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:06,332
Finding out Sinatra was dead
was a real curveball.

202
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,001
Ditto, most of my family.

203
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:10,419
Look, what happened back there
is not your fault.

204
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,048
That's just what happens
when two people live together.

205
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:16,651
That's a weird thing to say to your
girlfriend who just moved in with you.

206
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:20,889
- Do you think maybe we're going too fast?
- Oh, I get it.

207
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:24,642
So your friends got in a big fight and
that means we have to get in a big fight.

208
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,268
I don't want to get in a fight.

209
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,622
We moved in together
without much thought.

210
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,899
Yeah, it was your idea.
And it's been great.

211
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,525
Sure, it's great now.

212
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:35,820
But it could be not great later
and I feel like I'd be a bad boyfriend

213
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:39,175
if I didn't prematurely freak out
about that. I mean, what is this?

214
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,117
I don't know. It's been two weeks.

215
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:44,138
Let's give ourselves some time
before we rush to judgment.

216
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:48,374
- Can I tell you a joke?
- Uh, sure.

217
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,752
- Okay, so there's this gardener, right?
- Ugh. Is this a joke about nature?

218
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,629
- Would you just listen?
- Okay, okay.

219
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,798
So, the amazing thing
about this gardener

220
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,719
is that he always knows
exactly how many bags of mulch

221
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,264
he needs for a job, just by looking.

222
00:12:02,265 --> 00:12:04,640
Like, he gets it right every time.
He's the best.

223
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,185
So, one day he looks at a yard
he's working on,

224
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:09,395
and he's like, "18 bags."

225
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:12,941
So he goes to the store, buys 18 bags
of mulch and goes to work.

226
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:15,401
And when he's finished,
the flower beds are amazing.

227
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:19,155
- Beautiful roses, beautiful lilies...
- Orchid bushes?

228
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:21,532
You wouldn't have
a bush of orchids.

229
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,367
You said this gardener was the best.

230
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,703
Okay, fine, all right,
beautiful orchid bushes.

231
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:29,623
But there's one problem.
He still has one bag of mulch left.

232
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:33,002
He can't believe it.
This has never happened before.

233
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,671
Well, the extra bag of mulch
drives him crazy.

234
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:39,050
He's the guy who always gets
the right amount of mulch.

235
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:42,803
He's like, "Aah! Extra mulch, oh, no!"

236
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,890
So, on the drive home,
he throws the bag of mulch

237
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:48,535
out the window
over the side of the 101.

238
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,247
- And?
- Well, that's it.

239
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:53,814
- He throws it out the window.
- That's the punch line?

240
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,233
- It's kind of a thinker.
- I'll say.

241
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:57,152
Makes me think you forgot
the rest of the joke.

242
00:12:57,153 --> 00:12:58,736
No, no, oh, just picture it.

243
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:01,530
He's on the 101,
and he throws the bag of mulch

244
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,325
out over the side of the freeway.

245
00:13:03,326 --> 00:13:05,826
I got the narrative.
That wasn't the source of my confusion.

246
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,163
The confusion was
about the joke not being funny.

247
00:13:08,164 --> 00:13:09,998
Why does everything have to be funny?

248
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:12,583
Everything doesn't always have
to be funny. Just jokes.

249
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:15,520
Well, everyone at the network loves it.
Ha, ha.

250
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:18,505
Sorry, I just thought about it again.

251
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,507
- Ha! Mulch.
- Listen, Wanda.

252
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,761
I think maybe there's some things
we kind of glossed over

253
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,596
as we rushed into this relationship.

254
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,473
We don't know each other at all.

255
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,935
- Maybe we should take a step back and...
- BoJack, watch out!

256
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:33,289
- Aah!
- Oh, no!

257
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:37,359
- What was that?
- A stick? Tree branch? Nothing?

258
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,526
I heard someone scream, "Oh, no."

259
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,738
Yeah, that's the sound a stick makes
when you hit it with your car.

260
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,657
Fine. I'll see if the stick's okay.

261
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:47,534
Hey, what are you doing here in
the middle of the road? Are you crazy?

262
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,709
BoJack, we just hit a deer.
We have to get him to a hospital.

263
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,503
He's fine. He's in the woods.

264
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:00,382
You know, you hit a deer
and they limp off to the woods to...

265
00:14:00,383 --> 00:14:03,134
continue living their lives.
What are you doing?

266
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:05,719
I'm going to find him
and I'm going to help him.

267
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,681
If you wanna go for a walk
in the woods at night, go crazy,

268
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,641
but I'm not going anywhere.

269
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:12,726
Okay, knock yourself out.

270
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,021
I'll wait here, just me and my tunes.

271
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,399
It's A Prairie Home Companion...

272
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,108
- Oh, no.
- ...marathon...

273
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,568
- for the next 72 hours...
- Oh, God.

274
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,821
- ...commercial-free...
- No, thank you.

275
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:27,301
- ...on every single channel...
- What?!

276
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:30,513
Damn it.

277
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,919
BoJack to the rescue.

278
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,381
We should go back.
Nothing more we can do here.

279
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:44,175
If you don't wanna do this with me,
wait in the car.

280
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:46,677
- What is your plan here exactly?
- Oh.

281
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:49,097
- What? What is it?
- Footprints, 400 yards ahead.

282
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:52,058
- How can you see that far in the dark?
- I'm an owl.

283
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,952
Oh, right.

284
00:14:55,271 --> 00:14:57,373
Okay, now you're just showing off.

285
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,941
Are you okay? Ow.

286
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:03,694
Stay back! There's more pinecones
where that came from.

287
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:07,698
- Let us take you to the hospital.
- I can't go back to no hospital.

288
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,950
This is the fourth time
I've been hit this year.

289
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,078
Maybe you shouldn't
wear camouflage track suits.

290
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,540
I don't have health care.
I didn't pay my bills, so I'm in arrears.

291
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,210
A deer in arrears. Ha, ha.

292
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:21,545
What's that? She can't hear you.

293
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,714
She's got a deer in her ears.

294
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:27,469
Look, pal, I'll pay the bill, just...
Just let us get you to a damn hospital.

295
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,887
- I don't know.
- I know you've been hurt

296
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:33,015
and I know you're afraid.
We're all afraid.

297
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:36,810
But you have to trust us.
It's gonna be okay.

298
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:40,522
Not standing in the middle of the road
will also help, in the future.

299
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,567
- You're not gonna hurt me again?
- I am not going to hurt you.

300
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:44,818
Okay.

301
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:49,299
Starting now.

302
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:05,256
- They said he's gonna be okay.
- Oh, great. Great.

303
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:08,801
- Wanna hear another joke?
- Well, is it a joke or is it a story?

304
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:11,821
I'll listen to another story,
if you stop calling them jokes.

305
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:16,184
So, there's this couple who just started
dating and things are going really well.

306
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:20,229
One day, the girl finds a box of old love
letters from her high school boyfriend.

307
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,773
She reads them and, like,
loves how silly they are.

308
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:25,401
You know,
the drama of young romance.

309
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:28,154
So, on a whim, she sends the letters
to her ex-boyfriend

310
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,198
thinking he might find them funny too.

311
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:33,368
Well, okay, that night,
she tells her current boyfriend about it

312
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:34,868
and he loses his shit.

313
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,954
They get in a huge fight about it.

314
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:40,375
He's all, "Why would you send
your ex the old love letters?

315
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:42,626
He'll think
you're still in love with him!"

316
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:45,421
And she's just like, "Relax, Brandon!"

317
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:48,567
- Is the boyfriend's name Brandon?
- Yeah, that's the new boyfriend.

318
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,926
I forgot to mention that.
It doesn't matter.

319
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:54,680
So, anyway, now the night is ruined
because Brandon is obsessed.

320
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,766
He's like, "That ex-boyfriend's
going to come back for you.

321
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,310
He knows where you live!"

322
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:01,371
So, after dinner, he drives her home.

323
00:17:01,397 --> 00:17:04,232
She lives in one of those big buildings
by the freeway.

324
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:05,858
And he walks her to her door,

325
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:10,488
but he forgets to lock the car
and leaves the windows down.

326
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:13,699
He kisses her good night,
but things are kind of weird, you know?

327
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,743
Then he gets back in his car
and starts to drive away,

328
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,372
but when he glances
in his rear-view mirror,

329
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:21,874
his blood turns cold.

330
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,001
Guess what's in the back seat.

331
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:27,671
- The ex-boyfriend?
- No. The bag of mulch!

332
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,090
What? Oh.

333
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,594
Wow, that is actually
a really good joke.

334
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:35,863
I told you. Some things take time.

335
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:40,684
I'll take you home.

336
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:44,063
- Oh, come on, stick around a little.
- Nope. I gotta take Todd home.

337
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,274
Had a wonderful time.
Really. It just flew by.

338
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:48,502
- Come on, Todd, get in the car.
- Okay.

339
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,657
Um, do you wanna talk
about what happened?

340
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,744
What happened? No, I don't wanna talk
about what happened,

341
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,205
- I just wanna clean up.
- Okay.

342
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:03,874
- Why? What do you think happened?
- I just...

343
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:07,044
Because what I think happened
is that BoJack's girlfriend asked

344
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:10,339
what Tony Curtis was up to
and I said, "Tony Curtis died."

345
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,216
- And you said, "Did he?"
- Right, but...

346
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,885
And I said, "Yes, he did."
And you said, "Really?

347
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,512
- I'm not sure about that."
- Yeah...

348
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:19,806
And I said, "Well, I am."
And you said, "I'm not so sure."

349
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,226
And I said, "I'm telling you,
Tony Curtis is dead."

350
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:24,019
And you said,
"Let's check the Internet."

351
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,106
And I said, "We don't need to check
the Internet, I'm telling you he's dead."

352
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:30,067
And you said, "Let's just check though."

353
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:32,654
Is that what you think happened?

354
00:18:32,655 --> 00:18:34,280
So, do you wanna talk about it?

355
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,616
It kind of feels
like you wanna talk about it.

356
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:40,119
I don't understand why you couldn't
just believe that I know something.

357
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,912
I believe you know lots of things.

358
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:43,997
I just thought,
what's the harm in checking?

359
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,750
Especially since we have
these amazing little boxes now

360
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:50,630
with 24-hour access to the world's
largest source of information.

361
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:54,216
You shouldn't have to check if your wife
knows what she's talking about.

362
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:56,552
You humiliated me
in front of all my friends.

363
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:58,346
You can give it a rest. Show's over.

364
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:00,889
Okay, but don't I get
a little bit of credit

365
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:05,018
for inviting all of your friends
to an awesome surprise party?

366
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:09,022
No, because why did you think I would
want an awesome surprise party?

367
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,858
Is it the awesome part
you object to or...?

368
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,861
You always just assume
that everyone wants whatever you want.

369
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,947
Well, you know
what they say about assuming.

370
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,617
Makes an ass out of you and "Ming."

371
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:20,885
Who's Ming?

372
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:26,957
I'm sorry, Diane. Okay?
I'm sorry I threw you a party.

373
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,750
What a monster.

374
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:31,587
Throwing you a party
like some sort of terrorist.

375
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:34,214
It's a well-known fact
that if you really hate someone,

376
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,967
really wanna hit them where it hurts,
throw them a party.

377
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:40,179
That's why when we go to war,
we don't drop bombs on the enemy.

378
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:46,143
We drop parties! So, I'm so sorry
I threw you an amazing party.

379
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:49,813
You didn't throw me an amazing party.
You threw you an amazing party.

380
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,566
Everything today has been about you.

381
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:55,194
Really? That picnic we had
in the tea garden was about me?

382
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,988
That trip to the library was about me?

383
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:01,367
"Women on the Wall: An Exploration
of Gender in Text and Media,

384
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:04,953
Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer
in conversation with Helen Molesworth"

385
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,372
was about me?!

386
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:09,601
Oh, sure. Fine. Just walk away.

387
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:15,381
Oh. So now you're gonna play in the
ball pit without me? Real mature, Diane.

388
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:18,551
Why does my birthday party
have a ball pit?

389
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:21,845
- So I could get these T-shirts made.
- Ugh.

390
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,848
Also, you once told me
that when you were a little girl,

391
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,934
you dreamed of living in a house
that had a ballroom.

392
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,980
- A ballroom is not a room full... No!
- Heads up! Yes!

393
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:36,318
Mr. Peanutbutter, some part of you must
have known I wouldn't like any of this.

394
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,446
But I went balls-to-the-wall
for this party.

395
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:41,073
Literally, there are balls
all the way to the wall.

396
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:44,034
Right, but I've told you so many times,
I don't like parties.

397
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:45,994
But it's the thought that counts, right?

398
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,850
That's exactly... The thought was... Ugh!

399
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:57,590
- What did you do to the spare bedroom?
- Every room has a theme.

400
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:00,175
And this room's theme is Starbucks.

401
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:03,345
- Starbucks is not a theme.
- Can we not fight in the Starbucks?

402
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:05,431
I don't wanna be a couple
who fights at Starbucks.

403
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:08,850
Okay. Fine. You did go all out.

404
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:11,687
I really thought you'd like this.
I know you love Starbucks.

405
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:13,731
- I don't love...
- You don't love Starbucks,

406
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:17,401
you love the independent coffee place,
Starbucks is more convenient.

407
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:19,152
- Yeah.
- See?

408
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,196
I do sometimes listen.

409
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:24,241
- Can I get you a decaf Americano?
- Sure.

410
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:28,579
I know you put a lot of thought into today
and I appreciate that, really...

411
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,331
I have a decaf Americano
on the bar for Darren.

412
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,125
Is there a Darren here?

413
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:34,794
Says Darren on the cup.

414
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:37,379
Thank you. This is very realistic.

415
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,339
I know, right?

416
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,985
You wanna go check out the pool?
I filled it up with Jell-O.

417
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,532
Ah.

418
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,934
I still can't believe I'm 35.

419
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,079
Would you believe I'm 35?

420
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,649
- I'm still mad at you.
- I know.

421
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,941
But I don't wanna be.

422
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:00,152
Well, I don't want you
to be mad at me either.

423
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:04,072
We only have so many days together.
I want every one to be a happy one.

424
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:07,535
Oh, my God.
You don't want me to go to Cordovia.

425
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:09,662
- What?!
- You don't think I know what it means

426
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:11,497
when you say shit like...

427
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:14,625
"We only have so many days together"?

428
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:19,379
- Uh, what?
- "Diane, I love waking up next to you."

429
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,467
"Diane, I wish
every day could be like this."

430
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:25,887
- Yeah, but...
- "Just the two of us, together."

431
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:29,515
Do you have any idea how that feels
when I'm trying to plan my trip?

432
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:30,850
Okay. You got me!

433
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:33,185
Maybe I don't want my wife,

434
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:36,898
whom I love, to go off
on a terrifying six-month tour

435
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:40,442
of the most war-torn,
disease-splattered corners of the planet

436
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:43,236
with a charming, handsome,
billionaire bachelor.

437
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:46,072
What could I be thinking?
I'm such a terrible husband.

438
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,826
I'm not happy.

439
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:51,704
- With me?
- I don't know.

440
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:53,413
With everything.

441
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:56,709
I wake up in the morning
and I feel like I have no purpose.

442
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,546
And I'm 35. And if I don't make
some change in my life,

443
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:03,173
then this is how
I'm gonna feel forever.

444
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:04,592
- Honey...
- But then I think

445
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:07,720
about Sebastian St. Clair
and going to work with him,

446
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:10,472
helping people and making a difference.

447
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:13,935
And I feel like I have a reason
to get out of bed.

448
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:15,787
I didn't know you felt that way.

449
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:18,063
If you told me that,
I would have heard it.

450
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:21,358
Mr. Peanutbutter, you know I love you
and think you're a good dog.

451
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:24,862
Yes, you are. Yes, you are,
and I love your cute, funny face,

452
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:26,988
but I don't wanna be one
of those couples

453
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:30,242
that settles into a routine
and never changes.

454
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:33,453
Well, I don't know what to say
because I'm an old dog

455
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:35,247
and I'm not gonna change.

456
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:38,100
Do you know what I do
while you're at work all day?

457
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:41,253
I mostly just sit right there.

458
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:44,590
Sometimes I pretend to dig a little hole
and then I take a nap.

459
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:49,637
And when I hear your car in the driveway,
it is the best part of my day.

460
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:51,806
I mean, I go insane.

461
00:23:51,807 --> 00:23:55,016
I know, and I love you so much,

462
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:58,144
but you're never going
to be my only priority like that.

463
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,940
That's just not how I'm wired.

464
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:03,400
I need to also live my life.

465
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:06,821
Well... okay.

466
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:08,321
Is it okay?

467
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:13,869
If I change and try new things
and you still love me?

468
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:17,372
And you just stay the same person
you've always been and I still love you?

469
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:21,919
Uh, yeah, that sounds good to me.
Does that work for you?

470
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,755
Yeah, I think that works.

471
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:28,275
Just don't throw me
any more surprise parties, okay?

472
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:30,928
Uh, yeah, noted.

473
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:32,847
I can't believe you got me a ball pit.

474
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:37,517
And you're saying no part of you wants
to go jump in that ball pit right now?

475
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,020
Well, maybe a little.

476
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:42,272
- Does that make me a hypocrite?
- No, it just means you changed.

477
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:45,334
It's one of the things I love about you.

478
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:51,949
Surprise!

479
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,242
Hello? Anybody?

480
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,745
This is Paul McCartney.

481
00:24:56,746 --> 00:25:00,666
I came all this way to jump out of a cake?
Honest.

482
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:03,145
With a new suit on... Aye-yai-yai.

483
00:25:03,465 --> 00:25:08,659
