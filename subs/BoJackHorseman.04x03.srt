1
00:00:12,474 --> 00:00:13,508
Oh.

2
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:16,683
- He'll be here.
- But his part is in 16 bars.

3
00:00:19,364 --> 00:00:21,013
Excuse me. Sorry!

4
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:34,660
I heard before he played triangle
he was in a prison gang.

5
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:36,578
I heard he was a tech millionaire.

6
00:00:36,584 --> 00:00:39,003
There is a rumor he is a foreign prince.

7
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:42,292
His name is Todd Chavez.

8
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:45,796
And he's the most giving man
the world has ever known.

9
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,018
He saved my pregnant daughter

10
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,716
from drowning in a shipwreck,

11
00:00:49,722 --> 00:00:51,420
then he delivered her baby while

12
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,405
they rode on a piece of driftwood.

13
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,722
And then he circumcised her baby

14
00:00:55,728 --> 00:00:58,302
while they both hung from the
ladder of the rescue helicopter.

15
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,352
Of course, before he did,

16
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,855
Todd Chavez explained that circumcision

17
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,809
has somewhat fallen out of vogue.

18
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:07,484
They had a spirited
but respectful debate,

19
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,364
and by the end my daughter decided

20
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,177
that since we are of Jewish heritage,

21
00:01:11,183 --> 00:01:12,937
the boy might like to have the option

22
00:01:12,943 --> 00:01:15,059
to become religious if he so chooses.

23
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,827
Sounds like he really
helped your daughter

24
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:19,079
make the decision that
was right for her family.

25
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:22,291
And last year, when our triangle
player died of starvation

26
00:01:22,297 --> 00:01:24,257
after getting his foot
stuck in his triangle,

27
00:01:24,263 --> 00:01:27,081
Todd Chavez took over
because we needed him.

28
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,423
- What a guy!
- He is always helping others.

29
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,280
You know, sometimes

30
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,077
when that triangle part is coming up,

31
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:35,336
I find myself hoping he won't show up.

32
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:38,223
No man should be asked
to give that much.

33
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:41,373
- He is truly the best of all of...
- Whoa!

34
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:42,521
Oh, hey, guys.

35
00:01:42,527 --> 00:01:45,188
I was eating a taco earlier
and I got salsa on my shirt.

36
00:01:45,194 --> 00:01:46,867
I went to clean it off, but then when

37
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,561
I put my hands in the automatic dryer

38
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,611
I forgot I was still holding the taco.

39
00:01:50,617 --> 00:01:52,077
I got my hands all greasy,

40
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:54,669
so I couldn't open the
doorknob for an hour.

41
00:01:54,702 --> 00:01:56,913
What you guys talking about?

42
00:02:47,592 --> 00:02:50,794
- Synced and corrected by medvidecek007 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

43
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,618
So then at 11:00 you're gonna

44
00:02:57,624 --> 00:02:59,667
be giving a policy speech on fracking.

45
00:02:59,673 --> 00:03:00,799
Fracktastic!

46
00:03:00,886 --> 00:03:03,767
Meanwhile, all this talk of
whatever it is you're talking about

47
00:03:03,773 --> 00:03:05,811
- is making me hungry.
- Mmm?

48
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,521
Cheese? Yes, please!

49
00:03:07,527 --> 00:03:10,315
Todd, don't distract Mr. Peanutbutter
with your weird pocket cheeses.

50
00:03:10,321 --> 00:03:12,228
The issue is fracking and the people

51
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:13,863
really want to know your opinion.

52
00:03:13,869 --> 00:03:15,704
Well, then, color me "the people"

53
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,692
because I would also
like to know my opinion.

54
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,409
You don't have one yet. The
polling research comes in today

55
00:03:20,415 --> 00:03:23,506
and that will decide whether
you're for or against fracking.

56
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,747
Here's a thought: maybe
be against fracking.

57
00:03:25,753 --> 00:03:27,284
- It's terrible!
- Diane.

58
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,418
Just my opinion. You don't
tell me how to do my job.

59
00:03:29,424 --> 00:03:31,618
Also, fracking is the worst.
I can't believe you'd even

60
00:03:31,624 --> 00:03:33,079
- consider endorsing it.
- Diane.

61
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,006
None of my business.
Gotta get to work. Love you!

62
00:03:35,012 --> 00:03:37,181
- Bye, hon!
- But seriously, seriously,

63
00:03:37,187 --> 00:03:38,798
if you come out in support of fracking

64
00:03:38,804 --> 00:03:40,438
I'm gonna be super upset. Bye!

65
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,181
Where you stand on the issue
doesn't really matter.

66
00:03:43,187 --> 00:03:46,315
What's important is that you
seem sincere and emphatic.

67
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,418
Ohh. Are you a fan of charming but

68
00:03:48,424 --> 00:03:49,932
inessential Will Smith movies?

69
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,816
Because, slight Hitch, I
always show I'm empathic

70
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:56,071
by taking off my glasses
dramatically, but I kinda lost them.

71
00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:57,874
Wow! This must be what I'd look like

72
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,734
to a starving shipwrecked person.

73
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,950
When did you last see the glasses?

74
00:04:01,956 --> 00:04:03,750
I was in a meeting
with Princess Carolyn.

75
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,662
She was saying I'm
always forgetting stuff,

76
00:04:05,668 --> 00:04:07,118
so I whipped off my glasses,

77
00:04:07,124 --> 00:04:08,692
looked her square in the eye and said,

78
00:04:08,698 --> 00:04:10,431
"I never forget a thing."

79
00:04:10,508 --> 00:04:12,103
I might have left my glasses there.

80
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:13,581
Todd, you never do anything.

81
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,797
Why don't you take the
campaign bus over to VIM

82
00:04:15,803 --> 00:04:17,290
and get Mr. Peanutbutter's glasses?

83
00:04:17,296 --> 00:04:20,135
- Can you handle that?
- I never know if I can handle anything.

84
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:23,061
That's what makes my life so exciting.

85
00:04:23,544 --> 00:04:26,433
Mr. Peanutbutter, there's a delivery!

86
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,435
He's busy! Just sign for it.

87
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,604
I can't sign for another man's mail.

88
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,857
That's how I ended up with the
cremains of Cornelius Vanderbilt.

89
00:04:33,863 --> 00:04:35,969
It all started when a young Todd...

90
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,552
I don't have time for this!
I've got a job to do.

91
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,955
- It's Todd!
- It's me!

92
00:04:48,961 --> 00:04:50,836
You are just the guy I need.

93
00:04:50,852 --> 00:04:52,745
You know the actress Courtney Portnoy?

94
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,896
I think so. She portrayed the formerly

95
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,166
portly consort in The Seaport Resort?

96
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,341
Courtly roles like the
formerly portly consort

97
00:04:59,347 --> 00:05:02,058
are Courtney Portnoy's forte,
but she's got a new action movie

98
00:05:02,064 --> 00:05:04,742
that's supposed to change
her image: Ms. Taken.

99
00:05:04,748 --> 00:05:06,583
You know Mr. Taken
from the Taken movies?

100
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:08,308
- This is his niece.
- Nice!

101
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,311
This was supposed to be
Courtney's crossover coronation.

102
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,563
But that's sort of been
thwarted, unfortunately,

103
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,357
'cause Courtney's
purportedly falling short

104
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:17,073
of shoring up four-quadrant support.

105
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,027
Makes perfect sense so far.

106
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,196
The public sees her as out of touch.

107
00:05:21,202 --> 00:05:23,106
We need to make her seem relatable,

108
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,652
and the best way to do that

109
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,659
is to be seen dating a down-to-earth

110
00:05:26,683 --> 00:05:28,531
boring nobody like yourself.

111
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,497
You can do that, right?
You're not doing anything.

112
00:05:30,503 --> 00:05:33,339
I'm kind of busy today. I
gotta pick up these glasses,

113
00:05:33,345 --> 00:05:36,497
and then tonight there was
this meeting I wanted to go to.

114
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,410
This will take no time, I promise.

115
00:05:38,426 --> 00:05:39,542
Meet her for lunch.

116
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,925
The paparazzi will show
up, pop some razzis.

117
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:43,642
I do love getting my picture taken.

118
00:05:43,648 --> 00:05:44,985
It's proof I exist.

119
00:05:44,991 --> 00:05:47,383
Marvelous! Judah,
prepare the press release.

120
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,559
"Portnoy finds joy in
hoi polloi boy toy."

121
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,494
Well, we didn't get the polling
research on fracking...

122
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,955
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

123
00:05:57,961 --> 00:05:59,890
Because apparently when the delivery

124
00:05:59,914 --> 00:06:02,307
- came someone wouldn't sign for it.
- Ooh.

125
00:06:02,313 --> 00:06:05,192
In the future, whenever anyone asks

126
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,315
you to sign Mr. Peanutbutter's name,

127
00:06:07,321 --> 00:06:09,281
- just sign it.
- You got it, chief.

128
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:11,836
All right, Middle-Aged Yeller,
here's what you're gonna do.

129
00:06:11,842 --> 00:06:14,595
You're gonna give an
impassioned speech on fracking

130
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:17,848
that doesn't actually take a
stand either way on fracking.

131
00:06:17,854 --> 00:06:19,105
Okay.

132
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:22,144
Good morning!

133
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:23,812
Let's talk fracking.

134
00:06:23,896 --> 00:06:26,434
Everyone has very strong
opinions about it,

135
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,861
and I want you all to know,
right here and right now,

136
00:06:30,945 --> 00:06:32,821
I am taking a stand.

137
00:06:32,905 --> 00:06:35,866
I am on... your side!

138
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,577
- What side is that, specifically?
- Good question.

139
00:06:38,661 --> 00:06:41,747
I am specifically on
the side of the facts,

140
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,458
and also on the side of feelings.

141
00:06:44,464 --> 00:06:46,329
Well, I'm satisfied.

142
00:06:46,335 --> 00:06:49,380
Oh, excuse me, would Mr. Peanutbutter

143
00:06:49,386 --> 00:06:52,835
be willing to sign this letter
to our state government?

144
00:06:52,841 --> 00:06:54,819
Yes. I'll write his name on anything.

145
00:06:54,825 --> 00:06:56,243
Oh, thank you so much.

146
00:06:57,432 --> 00:07:00,644
And down goes Todd.

147
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,331
And up comes Todd!

148
00:07:04,186 --> 00:07:05,354
Aah!

149
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,801
- Whoa!
- Stay back!

150
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:08,476
Calm down, I'm not going to hurt you.

151
00:07:08,482 --> 00:07:11,938
My name is Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim-
Guerrero-Robinson-Zilberschlag

152
00:07:11,944 --> 00:07:14,405
- Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack.
- Wait, wait, wait.

153
00:07:14,488 --> 00:07:16,657
- What's your first name?
- Hollyhock.

154
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,075
And your last name?

155
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:19,889
Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero-Robinson-

156
00:07:19,921 --> 00:07:21,781
Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack.

157
00:07:21,787 --> 00:07:23,289
Got it.

158
00:07:23,372 --> 00:07:25,875
- Wait, what's your last name?
- I know, it's confusing.

159
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:28,872
- I have eight dads.
- How'd that happen? Test tubes?

160
00:07:28,878 --> 00:07:31,522
- No. I was adopted.
- Oh, of course.

161
00:07:31,528 --> 00:07:34,383
By eight men in a committed
gay polyamorous relationship.

162
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:37,630
- Less of course.
- But ever since I was a baby,

163
00:07:37,636 --> 00:07:39,437
people always said I looked like

164
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:41,874
- BoJack Horseman.
- That's a terrible

165
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,428
thing to say to a baby!

166
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:45,131
And I've always wondered if BoJack

167
00:07:45,137 --> 00:07:48,516
could be my biological... sperm guy.

168
00:07:48,522 --> 00:07:50,649
I guess it's possible.

169
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:54,153
BoJack used to say his penis
is like sun-dried tomatoes:

170
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:57,412
back in the '90s it got into everything.

171
00:07:57,573 --> 00:07:59,658
I came to L.A. to get
to the bottom of things.

172
00:07:59,742 --> 00:08:02,620
I even bought a deluxe spy kit.
Sorry about knocking you out.

173
00:08:02,703 --> 00:08:05,039
Once you have chloroform,
you can't not use it.

174
00:08:05,122 --> 00:08:07,708
No, I get it. BoJack had
one of those spy kits, too.

175
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,628
He mostly just used the
chloroform on himself, though.

176
00:08:10,711 --> 00:08:13,088
I read in his book
that you live together.

177
00:08:13,172 --> 00:08:16,216
- Can you help me find him?
- Sorry. I don't live there anymore.

178
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,719
And no one knows where
he's been for the last year.

179
00:08:18,802 --> 00:08:20,554
I guess I don't have to meet him.

180
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,425
All I need is a DNA sample,

181
00:08:22,457 --> 00:08:24,385
like a piece of hair or something.

182
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:26,347
I guess his house might have...

183
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:30,522
- Whoa!
- Sorry again. It's just so fun.

184
00:08:30,606 --> 00:08:33,525
Okay, there might be some
hairs in the shower drain,

185
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:35,736
but hard to know who they belong to.

186
00:08:35,742 --> 00:08:38,157
Everyone who has sex with BoJack usually

187
00:08:38,189 --> 00:08:40,735
takes a long shower afterwards.

188
00:08:40,741 --> 00:08:43,327
Hey, I think I see a hair.

189
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,492
Oh, no, BoJack.

190
00:08:45,498 --> 00:08:47,584
- Yoink!
- What the... was...

191
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:50,495
- Okay.
- Okay, let's blow.

192
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:53,462
Blow? Who's got blow?
Save some for BoJack. Huh?

193
00:08:53,468 --> 00:08:55,193
Wait, Todd? Oh, shit. Are you gonna

194
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:56,668
yell at me? Can I have the blow first?

195
00:08:56,674 --> 00:08:59,072
No. BoJack, there's no blow, okay?

196
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:00,672
And I'm not going to yell at you.

197
00:09:00,678 --> 00:09:02,508
- And what is this?
- I'm Hollyhock

198
00:09:02,514 --> 00:09:04,550
Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero-Robinson-

199
00:09:04,556 --> 00:09:06,725
Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack.

200
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:08,936
Of the New Haven Manheim-
Mannheim-Guerrero-Robinson-

201
00:09:08,942 --> 00:09:11,118
Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuacks?

202
00:09:11,188 --> 00:09:13,134
That was a joke. Obviously, I've never

203
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,109
heard of your family and/or law firm.

204
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:17,295
That was also a joke. Todd,

205
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,119
who is this tough crowd
you brought to my home?

206
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,943
- Um, BoJack, this is your daught...
- Mm-mmm, mm-mmm!

207
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:24,576
... dot-dot maid.

208
00:09:24,582 --> 00:09:26,042
Way to build up the suspense.

209
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,783
To, uh, tidy up the place
in case you came back.

210
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:30,416
You got me a maid? Thank you.

211
00:09:30,499 --> 00:09:32,418
Here I thought Channing
Tatum was a good neighbor

212
00:09:32,501 --> 00:09:34,128
for picking up my mail while I was gone,

213
00:09:34,211 --> 00:09:36,547
but you, and after all
the things I did to you,

214
00:09:36,553 --> 00:09:38,195
- I don't know how to tell you...
- BoJack,

215
00:09:38,201 --> 00:09:40,378
we haven't talked in like a year,

216
00:09:40,384 --> 00:09:42,594
and that's actually been
kind of working for me.

217
00:09:42,678 --> 00:09:44,638
So, maybe it's better if we just

218
00:09:44,677 --> 00:09:46,676
keep things like that, you know?

219
00:09:46,683 --> 00:09:47,792
Oh. Okay.

220
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,595
So then why did you hire me...

221
00:09:49,601 --> 00:09:51,270
Oh, yeah, deliver me.

222
00:09:52,014 --> 00:09:54,475
You're welcome.
Now go get that DNA tested.

223
00:09:57,526 --> 00:09:59,111
Can you tell me if this is a match?

224
00:09:59,117 --> 00:10:01,569
- A match with who?
- Hollyhock.

225
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:04,425
Manheim-Mannheim-Gorilla-Rub-a-Dub-Dub

226
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:07,644
Zoolander-Hallelujah-
something-McDonald's?

227
00:10:07,661 --> 00:10:10,199
Whatever those words are,
I need a sample from her, too.

228
00:10:10,205 --> 00:10:11,999
Duh!

229
00:10:12,082 --> 00:10:14,001
Bring it in an hour.
I gotta get to lunch.

230
00:10:14,084 --> 00:10:16,420
Nothing like working with hair,
blood, and semen all day

231
00:10:16,503 --> 00:10:18,797
to work up an appetite,
and it's already 1:00.

232
00:10:18,881 --> 00:10:21,508
1:00? I gotta go meet
my fake girlfriend!

233
00:10:21,592 --> 00:10:23,385
Oh, you have a fake girlfriend too?

234
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:26,138
Mine is a bunch of water
balloons with a blonde wig.

235
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,559
I suppose a fancy restaurant like this

236
00:10:30,642 --> 00:10:33,062
is too fancy for a common
man such as yourself.

237
00:10:33,074 --> 00:10:34,182
No, it's fine.

238
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:37,107
You'd probably like to take me
someplace rough and primitive.

239
00:10:37,191 --> 00:10:39,735
Uh... do you want me to
take you somewhere else?

240
00:10:39,818 --> 00:10:41,966
Well, if you must drag me on some

241
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,233
barbaric adventure, I can't stop you.

242
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:46,736
There's a Pony Roma's
at Universal CityWalk.

243
00:10:46,742 --> 00:10:48,827
A chain restaurant?
Oh, God, no, I'll be mugged.

244
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,114
I can't do this.

245
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,958
Todd, I can never be your
dirty peasant girl, I'm sorry.

246
00:10:52,964 --> 00:10:55,703
- I must abscond.
- Wait, Courtney!

247
00:10:59,338 --> 00:11:01,590
Scusi, sir, would you care for a sample

248
00:11:01,596 --> 00:11:04,962
of my father's famous
angel hair pomodoro?

249
00:11:04,968 --> 00:11:07,513
Famous father? Hair? Sample?

250
00:11:07,596 --> 00:11:09,681
- DNA?
- I no say DNA.

251
00:11:09,765 --> 00:11:11,809
I gotta get back to Hollyhock.

252
00:11:15,646 --> 00:11:18,857
Hollyhock, I need to get...

253
00:11:18,941 --> 00:11:20,603
- Did you clean anything?
- No.

254
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:22,532
But I am learning so much about

255
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,232
my possibly-maybe birth father.

256
00:11:24,238 --> 00:11:27,115
Like, did you know he has a shoebox
in his closet full of bad reviews

257
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:28,826
for other people's TV shows?

258
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:32,120
So all you've done so
far is snoop around?

259
00:11:32,204 --> 00:11:35,673
I also ate a box of donuts,
got sleepy and took a nap.

260
00:11:36,082 --> 00:11:38,627
Yeah, I'm not sure we really
need to do this DNA test.

261
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:40,343
Look, I didn't come all this way

262
00:11:40,504 --> 00:11:42,965
to not find out who my
biological father is.

263
00:11:43,048 --> 00:11:46,593
Okay, fine, then I just need you
to yank out a strand of hair

264
00:11:46,677 --> 00:11:50,347
- so I can take it down to the lab.
- No way! That sounds painful.

265
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,349
- Can't we just use your hair?
- Um...

266
00:11:52,432 --> 00:11:53,559
No.

267
00:11:53,642 --> 00:11:55,887
No, but I can pull out some

268
00:11:55,918 --> 00:11:57,723
of my hair at the same time,

269
00:11:57,729 --> 00:12:00,649
- so you don't have to do it alone.
- Okay, that sounds fair.

270
00:12:00,732 --> 00:12:01,859
On three, we pull.

271
00:12:01,942 --> 00:12:04,486
- One... two... three!
- Ow!

272
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,198
Oh, wait, I have this whole
comb full of hair in my bag.

273
00:12:08,282 --> 00:12:09,575
Duh!

274
00:12:09,658 --> 00:12:11,869
Todd, can I see you for a minute?

275
00:12:11,952 --> 00:12:14,746
This maid is the worst. I passed
out again for some reason.

276
00:12:14,752 --> 00:12:17,243
When I woke up, the house was
messier than when she started.

277
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:19,209
I don't mind someone else
in the house with me,

278
00:12:19,215 --> 00:12:20,942
in case I start choking on pills or

279
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,357
have a funny take on current
events that demands an audience,

280
00:12:23,363 --> 00:12:25,167
but if she can't do her
job, I gotta fire her.

281
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:28,051
You can't do that!
Here, buzz up real nice,

282
00:12:28,057 --> 00:12:30,279
take a nap, and while you're sleeping,

283
00:12:30,285 --> 00:12:32,058
I'll get the maid to clean

284
00:12:32,097 --> 00:12:34,391
so no one has to fire anyone.

285
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,314
Well, we did it.

286
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,110
What? I'm helping. I'm

287
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,673
cleaning out his DVR. Get it?

288
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,112
Okay, but you got it, right?

289
00:12:53,117 --> 00:12:54,368
♪ To-To-To-Todd! ♪

290
00:12:54,453 --> 00:12:56,038
Todd's phone, home of the Todd.

291
00:12:56,121 --> 00:12:58,123
You quarter-wit. Turn on the news.

292
00:12:58,206 --> 00:13:00,053
I don't want to be a manners police,

293
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:01,872
but a "hello" would be nice.

294
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,630
The letter, signed by
Mr. Peanutbutter himself,

295
00:13:04,713 --> 00:13:06,351
in full, unambiguous

296
00:13:06,406 --> 00:13:08,502
- support of fracking.
- Ooh.

297
00:13:08,508 --> 00:13:10,928
The gubernatorial hopeful
has until now played coy

298
00:13:10,934 --> 00:13:14,589
on the controversial issue of fra...

299
00:13:15,307 --> 00:13:18,268
What happened? Randy pass
out on his keyboard?

300
00:13:18,352 --> 00:13:20,771
Oh, he did? Oh, my God, is he okay?

301
00:13:20,777 --> 00:13:22,517
Well, did someone call Cynthia?

302
00:13:22,556 --> 00:13:23,935
No one called Cynthia?!

303
00:13:23,941 --> 00:13:26,849
For Christ's sake, this isn't just
a newsroom, this is a family!

304
00:13:26,855 --> 00:13:28,898
Jeez, I hope Randy's okay.

305
00:13:28,904 --> 00:13:32,115
Forget Randy. Did you sign that
letter for Mr. Peanutbutter?

306
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:35,160
Yes. Should I have not done the
thing you literally told me to do?

307
00:13:35,243 --> 00:13:36,995
Well, I guess we're pro-fracking now.

308
00:13:38,478 --> 00:13:40,457
Hey, buddy, I just want you to know

309
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,126
that while Katrina is filled
with white-hot frustration

310
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,879
as she has been for much of
this campaign, I'm not mad.

311
00:13:45,885 --> 00:13:48,170
I'm just nervous about what Diane

312
00:13:48,176 --> 00:13:49,501
will do when she finds out.

313
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:52,386
But I've got a plan, and it stars you!

314
00:13:52,392 --> 00:13:54,407
What? You want me to keep Diane away

315
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:56,733
from the TV, radio, and Internet?

316
00:13:56,765 --> 00:14:00,435
Ohh! That's a way better idea
than I had. Yeah, do that.

317
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:01,853
Hollyhock, I gotta run.

318
00:14:01,859 --> 00:14:03,732
I'll try to get the hairs tested today.

319
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,185
Just stay here and act maid-like.

320
00:14:06,191 --> 00:14:08,652
Ah, okay.

321
00:14:11,113 --> 00:14:13,593
Hey, look at me! I'm dancing.

322
00:14:13,648 --> 00:14:15,444
The time is now! Don't miss out!

323
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,231
Okay, Todd, that's some good

324
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:18,864
dancing, but I've got work to do

325
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,665
and you've been dancing
for... 55 minutes?!

326
00:14:21,748 --> 00:14:23,792
- What is this?
- It's a new dance.

327
00:14:23,798 --> 00:14:26,247
I call it the... come on, stall, Todd.

328
00:14:26,253 --> 00:14:27,766
Gotta think of something to call

329
00:14:27,772 --> 00:14:29,569
this fake dance you just made up.

330
00:14:30,048 --> 00:14:31,049
Samba.

331
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:33,802
That's amazing, and you're
amazing, and I want your pores.

332
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:36,043
Diane, I adored your sad

333
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:37,750
little story on refugees.

334
00:14:37,756 --> 00:14:40,344
We have so many articles about
things people care about.

335
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,901
It's like supes refreshing to see

336
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:43,514
something that doesn't make you click,

337
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,605
but it does make you think.

338
00:14:45,689 --> 00:14:47,983
Well, it's not like nobody
clicks on my articles.

339
00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:49,686
You don't care if people read your work

340
00:14:49,692 --> 00:14:51,414
or not. That's what's
so brave about you.

You disappeared before the

The whole point was to
get a picture with her.

Oh! Oops.

349

Uh, you want me to draw

She's gonna be at the Sharc Jacobs
fashion show in 30 minutes.

353
00:15:15,635 --> 00:15:18,638
There's an empty seat there
for her boyfriend, you.

354
00:15:18,722 --> 00:15:21,218
Be there, get the photo. Got it? Click.

355
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:23,471
So, I gotta go.

356
00:15:23,477 --> 00:15:25,431
How do I make people
care about important stuff

357
00:15:25,437 --> 00:15:28,148
when all they want to do is read
articles about who got slayed

358
00:15:28,154 --> 00:15:29,783
and who owned at the VMAs?

359
00:15:29,789 --> 00:15:33,195
When I need Mr. Peanutbutter
to take his heartworm pills,

360
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:35,781
I always hide it in
cheese so he doesn't know

361
00:15:35,864 --> 00:15:37,616
he's doing something he hates.

362
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:39,531
What if you take your important stuff

363
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,447
and hide it in some juicy gossip?

364
00:15:41,453 --> 00:15:43,246
That's actually a really good idea.

365
00:15:43,252 --> 00:15:44,378
But...

366
00:15:44,424 --> 00:15:46,958
I don't know any gossip and I
wouldn't even know where to look.

367
00:15:47,042 --> 00:15:48,293
The Internet?

368
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,452
No! Look at me!

369
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,883
Because I have potentially
earth-shattering inside info!

370
00:15:54,966 --> 00:15:57,928
That beloved famous person, uh...

371
00:15:58,011 --> 00:16:01,223
Channing Tatum may have
an illegitimate daughter

372
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:04,684
that's also a Cordovian refugee.

373
00:16:04,768 --> 00:16:07,270
- Are you serious?
- I have these two hairs.

374
00:16:07,354 --> 00:16:10,065
One is from Channing,
the other is from a baby.

375
00:16:10,148 --> 00:16:12,317
If the DNA lab confirms a match,

376
00:16:12,356 --> 00:16:13,604
you have your story.

Thanks, Todd. I owe you one.

378
00:16:15,404 --> 00:16:18,698
Okay, but if it's a match,
please call me first.

379
00:16:18,704 --> 00:16:21,290
'Cause, uh... 'cause
I love juicy gossip.

Uh... okay.

Uh... hmm... uh...

Where's the hollow look of someone
forced to starve themselves

390
00:16:52,274 --> 00:16:55,444
to fit our unrealistic expectation
of what beauty should be?

391
00:16:55,527 --> 00:16:57,404
He is not making it work.

- Huh?

393

Isn't fashion supposed
to be for everyone?

394
00:17:03,535 --> 00:17:05,829
That behatted boy is right.

395
00:17:05,835 --> 00:17:07,838
Fashion was never meant to be

396
00:17:07,878 --> 00:17:09,535
an inherently elitist form.

397
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,402
We need to return fashion

Right. How's Diane feel about that?

You could ask her yourself.

some smartass at Pizza Hut who

I wanted to fix things,

I've been so lucky to have people
in my life who care about me.

437
00:18:46,012 --> 00:18:47,305
I don't deserve any of them.

438
00:18:47,311 --> 00:18:49,558
I definitely don't deserve

- Yeah? Oh.
- Channing Tatum.

441
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:55,939
I'm only gonna hurt him like
I've hurt everyone else.

442
00:18:55,945 --> 00:18:57,505
I was a fool to think I could just

443
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,555

Can you go over to Channing Tatum's

444
00:19:00,561 --> 00:19:02,398
house, tell him I won't be his friend?

445
00:19:02,404 --> 00:19:04,823
I can't break another heart.
Not today, not Channing.

446
00:19:04,829 --> 00:19:06,122
Okay.

447
00:19:09,668 --> 00:19:11,027

'Cause I'm really looking forward
to dropping this whole maid thing,

00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:17,669
even though I'm kind of nailing it.

451
00:19:17,675 --> 00:19:19,359
Are you sure you want to know?

452
00:19:19,365 --> 00:19:20,848
I don't know if BoJack is ready

453
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,009

454
00:19:24,092 --> 00:19:25,218
Oh.

455
00:19:25,256 --> 00:19:26,445
Well, that's fine.

456
00:19:26,451 --> 00:19:27,846
I don't want a relationship.

457
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:29,347
I already have eight dads.

458
00:19:29,353 --> 00:19:30,982
It's not like a ninth dad is what

fill a hole in my life

460
00:19:32,688 --> 00:19:35,306
that the unconditional love of
eight dads couldn't already fill.

461
00:19:35,312 --> 00:19:36,563
Well, then good news.

462
00:19:36,646 --> 00:19:39,274
I got the results and...

463
00:19:39,802 --> 00:19:41,103
It's not a match.

464
00:19:41,109 --> 00:19:44,231
- Oh. Really?
- Yeah. Good news, right?

465
00:19:44,237 --> 00:19:45,864
I shouldn't have come here.

466
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:48,444
Papa Steve told me this was a bad idea.

467
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,619
But Papa Greg said, "Follow your heart."

468
00:19:50,702 --> 00:19:53,038
Then Papa Dashawn said,
"I agree with Greg."

Daddy Quackers said, "Let's put
it to a vote, quack-quack."

470
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,330
- Hello? Anybody home?
- Get down! Go, go, go! Shh.

471
00:19:59,336 --> 00:20:01,248
I can hear someone in there. Channing?

472
00:20:01,254 --> 00:20:04,049
Jenna Dewan? Their daughter,
Everly Elizabeth?

473
00:20:04,055 --> 00:20:05,776
Uh, it's me...

474
00:20:05,847 --> 00:20:07,129
Channing Tatum.

475
00:20:07,135 --> 00:20:09,763
I'm in the middle of,
uh, Channing right now,

476
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:12,145
but you can come back...

477
00:20:12,151 --> 00:20:15,018
- Tatum?
- Listen, I'm a reporter.

478
00:20:15,024 --> 00:20:17,986
I tested your DNA against
another sample's DNA,

479
00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:20,075
and apparently the two are related.

480
00:20:20,081 --> 00:20:22,350
- You're a father.
- Wait, what?

481
00:20:22,356 --> 00:20:24,235
- Okay. Thanks!
- Todd.

482
00:20:24,241 --> 00:20:25,943
I was going to write a story and

483
00:20:25,998 --> 00:20:27,524
drag your name through the mud

484
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,320
just because I thought a couple more

485
00:20:29,326 --> 00:20:31,379
people would click
on an article I wrote.

486
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:34,954
But I don't think that's the
kind of journalist I want to be.

487
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:37,916
Maybe I'm not cut out
for this line of work.

488
00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:39,209
Sorry to bother you.

489
00:20:39,215 --> 00:20:40,675
Uh...

490
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:42,863
Hey, I obviously don't know you

491
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,750
because I am Channing Tatum,

492
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:47,236
the guy from Green Lantern or whatever,

493
00:20:47,242 --> 00:20:50,464
and you are a nobody, but you
came all the way over here

494
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,014
to warn me about something
you hadn't even written yet.

495
00:20:53,098 --> 00:20:55,642
You ask me, movie star Channing Tatum,

496
00:20:55,725 --> 00:20:57,635
I'd say you're exactly the kind of

497
00:20:57,643 --> 00:20:59,598
journalist we need in this world.

498
00:20:59,604 --> 00:21:00,689
Wow!

499
00:21:00,772 --> 00:21:04,275
That doesn't sound at all
like Channing Tatum's voice,

500
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:06,510
but that is the kind of thing I would

501
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:08,649
want Channing Tatum to say to me,

502
00:21:08,655 --> 00:21:10,532
so thanks, Channing.

503
00:21:10,538 --> 00:21:11,860
Love half your movies!

504
00:21:11,866 --> 00:21:14,577
That was a close one, huh, Hollyhock?

505
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:17,455
- Hollyhock?
- ♪ To-To-To-Todd! ♪

506
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:19,374
Todd's phone. What do you want?

507
00:21:19,457 --> 00:21:22,293
So, I see lots of pictures
of you at the fashion show,

508
00:21:22,377 --> 00:21:25,255
- but none of you with Courtney.
- Oh, crap!

509
00:21:27,507 --> 00:21:28,800
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

510
00:21:28,806 --> 00:21:30,921
Uh, why are you wearing my clothes?

511
00:21:30,927 --> 00:21:32,875
These aren't anything like your clothes.

512
00:21:32,883 --> 00:21:35,426
This hat alone cost $50,000.

513
00:21:35,432 --> 00:21:37,635
Oh. So, uh...

514
00:21:37,651 --> 00:21:39,513
What's it like being a movie star?

515
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:40,979
It's awfully trying.

516
00:21:41,062 --> 00:21:43,642
Do you ever feel like
everyone's looking at you

517
00:21:43,648 --> 00:21:46,992
- but nobody sees you?
- Yeah, that's exactly how I feel.

518
00:21:46,998 --> 00:21:48,686
No, I was speaking rhetorically about

519
00:21:48,692 --> 00:21:50,357
a feeling that only movie stars get.

520
00:21:50,363 --> 00:21:51,400
Ohh.

521
00:21:51,406 --> 00:21:53,742
- Okay.
- But it feels good to talk about it.

522
00:21:53,777 --> 00:21:55,862
Yeah. Talking's good.

523
00:21:55,994 --> 00:21:59,122
You know, there was a meeting
I was supposed to go to tonight,

524
00:21:59,205 --> 00:22:02,000
but I don't think I'm gonna go.
I don't know if I'm ready.

525
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,577
- Ready for what?
- What if it's not everything

526
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:05,920
I want it to be?

527
00:22:05,926 --> 00:22:08,168
Sometimes the idea of something is

528
00:22:08,174 --> 00:22:09,953
better than the truth, you know?

529
00:22:10,008 --> 00:22:12,886
I always prefer fiction
to truth, personally.

530
00:22:12,892 --> 00:22:14,548
I've staked my career on it.

531
00:22:14,554 --> 00:22:16,306
Yeah, that makes sense.

532
00:22:16,389 --> 00:22:18,224
- Ha hah!
- Smile for the birdie.

533
00:22:18,308 --> 00:22:20,810
Hey, Courtney, you canoodling
with a supermodel now?

534
00:22:20,894 --> 00:22:22,437
- That's right.
- Fancy.

535
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,773
I love how not down-to-earth
you are together.

536
00:22:24,856 --> 00:22:27,859
This is going to really make
headlines when you two break up.

537
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:31,362
Here's an even bigger headline:
we shan't be breaking up.

538
00:22:31,446 --> 00:22:33,531
- We're engaged!
- Wowee!

539
00:22:33,537 --> 00:22:36,415
Hooray! I'm confused!

540
00:22:38,203 --> 00:22:40,830
Hollyhock? Are you here?

541
00:22:40,914 --> 00:22:43,458
No, but BoJack, who lives here, is here.

542
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:46,252
BoJack, I gotta tell you, um...

543
00:22:47,212 --> 00:22:49,464
- Hollyhock is your daughter.
- What do you mean?

544
00:22:49,547 --> 00:22:51,216
- She's your daughter.
- I don't understand.

545
00:22:51,222 --> 00:22:52,991
- She has Horseman DNA.
- What is that mean?

546
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,927
- You're her father.
- That's impossible. I'm BoJack.

547
00:22:54,933 --> 00:22:56,925
She didn't want me to tell you,

548
00:22:56,957 --> 00:22:59,746
but I thought you should know.

549
00:22:59,752 --> 00:23:01,219
I guess I don't blame her.

550
00:23:01,225 --> 00:23:02,590
I wouldn't want to be
my daughter either.

551
00:23:02,596 --> 00:23:03,675
BoJack...

552
00:23:03,681 --> 00:23:05,766
Look what I do to people
I'm supposed to care about.

553
00:23:05,772 --> 00:23:08,775
I had sex with the one person I've
ever seen you be in love with.

554
00:23:08,781 --> 00:23:12,105
I guess they're not gonna put you
in the best friends hall of fame,

555
00:23:12,111 --> 00:23:14,364
but I don't know that I loved her.

556
00:23:14,447 --> 00:23:16,199
I don't think I'm allowed to be in love.

557
00:23:16,282 --> 00:23:18,618
Don't say that. You do
so much for everybody.

558
00:23:18,624 --> 00:23:20,656
All you ever asked for was
a roof over your head

559
00:23:20,662 --> 00:23:22,324
and the occasional s'more in a baguette.

560
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,791
I'm telling you, it's a
million-dollar idea.

561
00:23:24,874 --> 00:23:26,584
I got more of you than I ever deserved.

562
00:23:26,745 --> 00:23:28,872
If you never talk to me again
I just want you to know

563
00:23:28,878 --> 00:23:31,881
that I appreciate it,
and I appreciate you.

564
00:23:31,965 --> 00:23:33,424
Thanks.

565
00:23:33,508 --> 00:23:37,178
It was shitty what you did
with Emily, but, um...

566
00:23:37,184 --> 00:23:38,719
I think I'm...

567
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:41,843
Asexual.

568
00:23:41,926 --> 00:23:44,471
A sexual what? Dynamo, deviant?

569
00:23:44,477 --> 00:23:46,301
Harassment lawsuit waiting to happen?

570
00:23:46,307 --> 00:23:49,685
No. Asexual, not sexual.

571
00:23:49,691 --> 00:23:52,070
- Ohh.
- I'm sure you think that's weird.

572
00:23:52,076 --> 00:23:54,070
Are you kidding? That's amazing.

573
00:23:54,076 --> 00:23:56,149
Sometimes I wish I was asexual.

574
00:23:56,155 --> 00:23:58,199
Maybe then I wouldn't
have a strain of herpes.

575
00:23:58,205 --> 00:23:59,831
- You have multiple strains...
- I know.

576
00:23:59,837 --> 00:24:01,286
The joke only works with the "a".

577
00:24:01,292 --> 00:24:04,837
It actually feels nice to
finally say it out loud.

578
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,174
I am an asexual person.

579
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:10,211
- I am asexual.
- That's great.

580
00:24:10,295 --> 00:24:12,630
So if you're not mad about Emily...

581
00:24:12,636 --> 00:24:15,430
It wasn't just Emily, BoJack,

582
00:24:15,592 --> 00:24:18,636
and I don't know if I'm ready
for us to be friends again yet.

583
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,806
- Oh. Okay.
- But we can be more than not-friends.

584
00:24:21,966 --> 00:24:23,343
You know, for an asexual,

585
00:24:23,349 --> 00:24:26,388
more than not-friends is probably
as good as it gets, right?

586
00:24:26,394 --> 00:24:28,896
I'm not really at a place yet
where I want to joke about it.

587
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,358
- Got it, got it, totally.
- But it feels good to talk about it.

588
00:24:32,442 --> 00:24:34,652
Well, if you ever need a place
to crash, that couch...

589
00:24:34,658 --> 00:24:36,409
- I'm gonna go.
- Oh.

590
00:24:36,571 --> 00:24:38,781
- Right now?
- Welcome back, BoJack.

591
00:24:38,865 --> 00:24:40,617
It's good to see you.

592
00:24:42,686 --> 00:24:44,104
Uh...

593
00:24:44,462 --> 00:24:45,538
Hmm.

594
00:24:47,457 --> 00:24:48,583
Todd?

595
00:24:57,023 --> 00:24:59,457
_

596
00:25:08,978 --> 00:25:11,147
Hmm.

597
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,899
Good for him.

598
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:05,293
