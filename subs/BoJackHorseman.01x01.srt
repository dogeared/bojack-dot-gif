1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:08,247
Horsin' Around is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,499
Mondays.

3
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:13,377
Well, good morning to you too.

4
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:14,711
Oh, hey.

5
00:00:14,795 --> 00:00:16,547
Where? I'd love hay.

6
00:00:19,758 --> 00:00:22,803
In 1987, the situation
comedy Horsin' Around

7
00:00:22,886 --> 00:00:24,263
premiered on ABC.

8
00:00:24,346 --> 00:00:26,474
The show, in which a young, bachelor horse

9
00:00:26,557 --> 00:00:28,684
is forced to reevaluate his priorities

10
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:31,103
when he agrees to raise
three human children,

11
00:00:31,186 --> 00:00:32,980
was initially dismissed by critics

12
00:00:33,063 --> 00:00:36,567
as broad and saccharine and not good,

13
00:00:36,651 --> 00:00:39,278
but the family comedy
struck a chord with America

14
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:41,530
and went on to air for nine seasons.

15
00:00:41,614 --> 00:00:44,575
The star of Horsin'
Around, BoJack Horseman,

16
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:45,784
is our guest tonight.

17
00:00:45,867 --> 00:00:47,035
Welcome, BoJack.

18
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,579
It is good to be here, Charlie.

19
00:00:48,663 --> 00:00:49,913
Sorry I was late. The traffic...

20
00:00:49,997 --> 00:00:51,290
It's really no problem.

21
00:00:51,373 --> 00:00:52,541
I parked in a handicapped spot.

22
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:53,626
I hope that's okay.

23
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:54,710
You parked in a...

24
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:55,794
I'm sorry, disabled spot.

25
00:00:55,877 --> 00:00:58,380
Is that the proper nomenclature?

26
00:00:58,464 --> 00:01:00,007
Maybe you should move the car.

27
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,425
No, I don't think I should drive right now.

28
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:03,302
I'm incredibly drunk.

29
00:01:03,385 --> 00:01:06,180
You're telling me that
you're drunk right now?

30
00:01:06,263 --> 00:01:08,182
Is it just me, or am I
nailing this interview?

31
00:01:08,265 --> 00:01:09,558
I kind of feel like I'm nailing it.

32
00:01:09,642 --> 00:01:11,185
Yes.

33
00:01:11,268 --> 00:01:13,979
Anyway, we were talking
about Horsin' Around.

34
00:01:14,062 --> 00:01:16,273
To what do you attribute
the show's wide appeal?

35
00:01:16,357 --> 00:01:17,692
Charlie, listen, you know,

36
00:01:17,774 --> 00:01:18,942
I know that it's very hip these days

37
00:01:19,026 --> 00:01:20,611
to shit all over Horsin' Around,

38
00:01:20,695 --> 00:01:22,070
but at the time, I can tell you...

39
00:01:22,154 --> 00:01:23,322
- Is it okay to say "shit"?
- Please don't.

40
00:01:23,405 --> 00:01:24,615
'Cause I... I think the show's

41
00:01:24,699 --> 00:01:26,241
actually pretty solid for what it is.

42
00:01:26,325 --> 00:01:27,826
It's not Ibsen, sure,

43
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:29,411
but look, for a lot of people,

44
00:01:29,495 --> 00:01:31,955
life is just one long,
hard kick in the urethra,

45
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,957
and sometimes when you get home

46
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:35,834
from a long day of getting
kicked in the urethra,

47
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:38,795
you just want to watch a show
about good, likable people

48
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,130
who love each other,

49
00:01:40,214 --> 00:01:41,757
where, you know, no matter what happens,

50
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,509
at the end of 30 minutes,

51
00:01:43,592 --> 00:01:45,177
everything's gonna turn out okay.

52
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,054
You know, because in real life...

53
00:01:47,137 --> 00:01:49,724
Did I already say the
thing about the urethra?

54
00:01:49,806 --> 00:01:51,433
Well, let's talk about real life.

55
00:01:51,517 --> 00:01:53,602
What have you been doing
since the show's cancellation

56
00:01:53,686 --> 00:01:54,978
18 years ago?

57
00:01:55,062 --> 00:01:56,355
That's a great question, Charlie.

58
00:01:56,438 --> 00:01:58,607
I, uh...

59
00:01:58,691 --> 00:02:00,150
Uh, I...

60
00:02:01,652 --> 00:02:03,945
Um...

62
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:03,130
Maury! Maury! Maury! Maury!

63
00:03:03,213 --> 00:03:04,965
In the case of one-year-old Phoenix,

64
00:03:05,048 --> 00:03:07,426
you are the father.

65
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:09,886
Morning, sunshine.

66
00:03:11,221 --> 00:03:12,723
Why so gloomy, roomie?

67
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:13,808
First of all, we're not roommates.

68
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,350
You are my houseguest.

69
00:03:15,434 --> 00:03:17,603
Well, we don't need to
put labels on things.

70
00:03:17,686 --> 00:03:19,480
You sleep on my couch,
and you don't pay rent.

71
00:03:19,563 --> 00:03:21,732
I've had tapeworms that
were less parasitic.

72
00:03:21,816 --> 00:03:22,817
I don't even remember why I let you

73
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:24,109
stay with me in the first place.

74
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:25,444
Because my parents kicked me out,

75
00:03:25,527 --> 00:03:27,154
and I had nowhere to go,

76
00:03:27,237 --> 00:03:28,614
and even though you don't
want anyone to know it...

77
00:03:33,994 --> 00:03:36,079
You secretly have a good heart.

78
00:03:36,163 --> 00:03:37,372
You told me they didn't approve

79
00:03:37,456 --> 00:03:39,166
of your "alternative lifestyle."

80
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:40,459
I thought you were, like,

81
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:41,960
a troubled gay teen or something.

82
00:03:42,043 --> 00:03:43,545
I didn't realize by "alternative lifestyle"

83
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:44,880
that you meant you were lazy.

84
00:03:44,963 --> 00:03:47,048
That's on you for making assumptions.

85
00:03:47,132 --> 00:03:49,343
Also, if you're looking
for the Toaster Strudels,

86
00:03:49,426 --> 00:03:51,679
I got really high last
night and ate them all.

87
00:03:54,014 --> 00:03:56,350
Did you say you've had tapeworms?

88
00:04:00,813 --> 00:04:02,022
Thanks for meeting me here.

89
00:04:02,105 --> 00:04:03,732
I would have invited you to my office,

90
00:04:03,816 --> 00:04:05,818
but the electric company
shut off our power.

91
00:04:05,901 --> 00:04:06,902
That's unfortunate.

92
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:08,445
Just an issue with the bank

93
00:04:08,529 --> 00:04:09,864
and a lack of money in it.

94
00:04:09,946 --> 00:04:12,157
Now, as you know, Penguin is very eager

95
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,408
to publish your memoirs,

96
00:04:13,492 --> 00:04:15,536
but you keep missing your deadlines.

97
00:04:15,619 --> 00:04:16,787
I know, and I'm sorry,

98
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:18,539
but I am making great progress.

99
00:04:18,622 --> 00:04:22,250
The BoJack Horseman Story,

100
00:04:22,334 --> 00:04:24,837
written by BoJack Horseman.

101
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,380
Chapter one.

102
00:04:27,381 --> 00:04:29,383
Chapter one.

103
00:04:30,676 --> 00:04:34,429
Chapter...

104
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:37,558
One.

105
00:04:37,641 --> 00:04:39,685
Look, we really need a
bestseller here at Penguin.

106
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:42,437
Things are not that
great for me, money wise.

107
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:44,606
Aren't you an editor at
a major publishing house?

108
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,525
Yeah, a publishing house.

109
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:48,151
When was the last time you saw a book?

110
00:04:48,235 --> 00:04:49,444
I thought I saw someone

111
00:04:49,528 --> 00:04:50,863
reading one in the park the other day,

112
00:04:50,946 --> 00:04:52,364
but it turned out it was a takeout menu.

113
00:04:52,447 --> 00:04:54,533
Whenever you're ready.

114
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:00,372
We're living month to month here.

115
00:05:00,455 --> 00:05:02,123
We're kind of counting
on your autobiography

116
00:05:02,207 --> 00:05:03,542
to save the company, no pressure.

117
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,168
That's actually a lot of pressure.

118
00:05:05,252 --> 00:05:07,128
Have you considered
working with a ghostwriter?

119
00:05:07,254 --> 00:05:08,756
Ugh, no, thank you.

120
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,340
Look, just give me one more week,

121
00:05:10,424 --> 00:05:11,926
and I will give you some pages

122
00:05:12,008 --> 00:05:13,969
that'll knock your ass
back to the South Pole.

123
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:15,429
I'm from Cincinnati.

124
00:05:15,512 --> 00:05:17,180
It... that doesn't matter.

125
00:05:17,264 --> 00:05:18,473
I'll call you in a week.

126
00:05:18,557 --> 00:05:19,558
Yes, one week.

127
00:05:19,641 --> 00:05:20,809
I'm telling you,

128
00:05:20,893 --> 00:05:23,771
this book is a top priority for me.

129
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,235
Oh, right. Yeesh.

130
00:05:32,237 --> 00:05:33,864
You're wearing that to the prom?

131
00:05:33,948 --> 00:05:35,699
What, you don't think it's cute?

132
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:38,452
Neigh way, Jose.

133
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,915
"Neigh way, Jose."

134
00:05:42,998 --> 00:05:44,792
I improvised that line.

135
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,126
I mean, it was written,

136
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:48,044
but I gave it the old BoJack spin.

137
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:50,505
Hey, how many times have
you watched this episode?

138
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:51,882
Yeah, but do you get it, though?

139
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:53,258
Because "nay" means no,

140
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:54,885
but it's also a thing that horses say.

141
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:56,804
It works on every level.

142
00:05:56,887 --> 00:05:58,973
- I get it.
- Ah, you don't get it.

143
00:06:22,913 --> 00:06:24,122
Are you drunk?

144
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:25,749
Todd, I weigh over 1,200 pounds.

145
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,460
It takes a lot of beer to get me drunk.

146
00:06:28,543 --> 00:06:29,544
Yes.

147
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:31,171
Ah, yeah, I see.

148
00:06:31,254 --> 00:06:33,131
You're just bummed out
because Princess Carolyn

149
00:06:33,214 --> 00:06:34,466
dumped you last night.

150
00:06:36,593 --> 00:06:38,303
BoJack, we need to talk.

151
00:06:38,386 --> 00:06:39,763
Hey, check out the rug on that guy.

152
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:41,139
Slow and steady, am I right, ladies?

153
00:06:42,307 --> 00:06:43,642
Ha-cha-cha.

154
00:06:43,725 --> 00:06:45,143
Who does he think he's fooling?

155
00:06:45,226 --> 00:06:46,603
Turtles don't have hair.

156
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:47,855
Stop embarrassing me.

157
00:06:47,938 --> 00:06:49,439
That is Lenny Turteltaub.

158
00:06:49,523 --> 00:06:51,025
You know, I am not crazy
about the bread here.

159
00:06:51,107 --> 00:06:52,108
Mm.

160
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:53,652
Why do I keep eating it?

161
00:06:53,735 --> 00:06:56,571
BoJack, can you please
just listen for a second?

162
00:06:56,655 --> 00:06:59,867
You have my undivided attention.

163
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,327
I think we should see other people.

164
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,454
Were we not seeing other people?

165
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:08,834
BoJack, I'm almost there.

166
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:10,293
Wait. Shh! Shut up.

167
00:07:10,377 --> 00:07:13,463
Now, that's a horse of a different...

168
00:07:13,547 --> 00:07:14,548
cruller?

169
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:16,383
Oh!

170
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:19,219
God, that's good comedy.

171
00:07:19,302 --> 00:07:20,888
- BoJack!
- What?

172
00:07:20,971 --> 00:07:22,138
Everyone gets a mulligan,

173
00:07:22,222 --> 00:07:25,183
and my mulligan was Carey Mulligan.

174
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:28,103
I'm kidding, jeez. It was Emily Mortimer.

175
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:29,938
What is the problem here?

176
00:07:30,022 --> 00:07:31,982
Are you embarrassed of
me because I'm a has-been?

177
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:33,692
Because you know that I'm writing that book

178
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:35,694
that is gonna make everybody love me again.

179
00:07:35,777 --> 00:07:37,654
You're not really writing a book.

180
00:07:37,738 --> 00:07:38,906
Well, I already spent my advance,

181
00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:40,240
so that's a first step.

182
00:07:40,323 --> 00:07:41,909
Look, this has been a lot of fun,

183
00:07:41,992 --> 00:07:43,660
but I need to start
thinking about my future.

184
00:07:43,744 --> 00:07:45,662
I mean, you don't even respect me enough

185
00:07:45,746 --> 00:07:46,747
to have a baby with me.

186
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,831
Whoa, what?

187
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:49,374
I never explicitly said that.

188
00:07:49,457 --> 00:07:51,001
You said it with your actions.

189
00:07:51,085 --> 00:07:52,127
What actions?

190
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:55,213
Oh, look at that baby.

191
00:07:55,296 --> 00:07:57,424
Isn't he the cutest baby you ever saw?

192
00:07:57,507 --> 00:07:58,926
What? What? What? No, no, wha...

193
00:08:10,395 --> 00:08:12,188
Step away from
the stolen vehicle, sir!

194
00:08:12,272 --> 00:08:14,024
No, no, no.
Misunderstanding, officer.

195
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:15,692
I was running away from my girlfriend

196
00:08:15,776 --> 00:08:18,028
whom I don't respect
enough to have a baby with.

197
00:08:18,112 --> 00:08:20,447
Hey, aren't you the
horse from Horsin' Around?

198
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,075
Oh, face it. You're afraid of commitment.

199
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:24,701
I'm not afraid of commitment.

200
00:08:24,785 --> 00:08:26,327
I commit to things all the time.

201
00:08:26,411 --> 00:08:28,038
It's the following
through on that commitment

202
00:08:28,122 --> 00:08:29,205
that I take issue with.

203
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:31,041
Hey, stupid, isn't that
your friend over there?

204
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,626
Oh, Mr. Peanutbutter?

205
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:34,002
God, I hope he doesn't see us.

206
00:08:34,086 --> 00:08:36,254
Is that BoJack Horseman?

207
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:37,714
Oh, jeez, here we go.

208
00:08:37,798 --> 00:08:39,091
Mr. Peanutbutter

209
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:41,969
and BoJack Horseman in the same room.

210
00:08:42,052 --> 00:08:44,304
What is this, a crossover episode?

211
00:08:44,387 --> 00:08:46,140
You know, that gets funnier every time.

212
00:08:46,222 --> 00:08:47,724
You're being sarcastic,

213
00:08:47,808 --> 00:08:49,601
but I think it does actually
get funnier every time.

214
00:08:49,684 --> 00:08:51,019
We're actually in the middle
of breaking up right now,

215
00:08:51,103 --> 00:08:52,813
- so if you could just...
- Yeah?

216
00:08:52,896 --> 00:08:54,397
- You're in the middle of it?
- Yeah, that's right.

217
00:08:54,481 --> 00:08:57,442
So would it be awkward
if I joined you right now?

218
00:08:57,525 --> 00:08:58,986
Yes, actually, it's very awkward.

219
00:08:59,069 --> 00:09:00,236
Is that not clear?

220
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,781
Yeah, this is awkward right now?

221
00:09:02,864 --> 00:09:04,032
Yes, please leave.

222
00:09:04,116 --> 00:09:05,617
How are you, Mr. Peanutbutter?

223
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,078
Oh, living the dream,
P.C., living the dream.

224
00:09:08,162 --> 00:09:09,579
Why are you making conversation?

225
00:09:09,663 --> 00:09:11,081
Oh, let's see, it's the English word...

226
00:09:11,165 --> 00:09:13,000
It's called being polite, BoJack.

227
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,085
But am I crazy that this is a bad time?

228
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:17,420
Always a Clydesdale,
never a Clyde, eh, BoJack?

229
00:09:17,545 --> 00:09:18,797
What?

230
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,423
You'll get that one later, man.

231
00:09:20,507 --> 00:09:22,258
Erica, get out of here with that face.

232
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:23,510
Would it kill you to be civil?

233
00:09:23,593 --> 00:09:25,220
This is why we're breaking up.

234
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:27,263
So it's not because of
the thing with the baby?

235
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:29,099
It's because of a lot of things!

236
00:09:29,183 --> 00:09:30,642
Waiter, could we please have the check?

237
00:09:30,725 --> 00:09:32,227
- Thank you.
- We haven't even ordered yet.

238
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,063
I have wasted so many dinners
on you, BoJack Horseman.

239
00:09:35,147 --> 00:09:37,607
I don't know how you can
expect anyone else to love you

240
00:09:37,691 --> 00:09:39,359
when you so clearly hate yourself.

241
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:42,070
- Here you go.
- Let me see that.

242
00:09:42,154 --> 00:09:45,240
$10 for bread?

243
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:46,950
I don't want to live in a society

244
00:09:47,034 --> 00:09:48,660
where the premeal bread isn't free.

245
00:09:48,743 --> 00:09:51,538
It is free if you order a meal.

246
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:53,165
Can you take me home, please?

247
00:09:53,248 --> 00:09:54,708
Yeah, but I didn't even
eat that much bread.

248
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:55,792
What did I have? I must have had...

249
00:09:55,876 --> 00:09:58,003
You ate nine baskets, sir.

250
00:09:58,086 --> 00:09:59,462
Nine... really?

251
00:09:59,587 --> 00:10:01,631
Great, now I'm gonna feel
like a fat ass all week.

252
00:10:03,508 --> 00:10:05,468
You've seen me naked. Do
you think I'm getting chubby?

253
00:10:05,552 --> 00:10:07,095
You want to know the real
reason we're breaking up?

254
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:08,263
What was that? Sorry.

255
00:10:08,346 --> 00:10:10,598
Couldn't hear you over the sound
of my calories not metabolizing.

256
00:10:10,682 --> 00:10:12,684
This is so classic you.

257
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:14,102
You're using this bread thing

258
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:16,021
to avoid talking about our relationship.

259
00:10:16,104 --> 00:10:17,981
No, that is definitely not happening.

260
00:10:18,065 --> 00:10:19,774
I'd like to go home now.

261
00:10:22,194 --> 00:10:23,403
You think I'm fat.

262
00:10:23,486 --> 00:10:25,321
So yeah, technically I was dumped,

263
00:10:25,405 --> 00:10:27,157
but the real headline of the evening was,

264
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:29,659
"Dumb guy eats bread, gets fat, the end."

265
00:10:29,743 --> 00:10:32,079
What kind of headline is that?

266
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:34,289
Wasn't there a pizza here a second ago?

267
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:36,583
God damn it! Stop the presses.

268
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,418
You're not fat.

269
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:41,088
Oh, hey, let's throw a
party. That'll cheer you up.

270
00:10:41,213 --> 00:10:43,673
No, it won't. It'll cheer you up.

271
00:10:43,757 --> 00:10:45,133
I'll stand in the corner by myself

272
00:10:45,217 --> 00:10:46,801
eating cotton candy until I barf

273
00:10:46,885 --> 00:10:48,803
like I did at your last party.

274
00:10:48,887 --> 00:10:52,432
Hey, aren't you the
horse from Horsin' Around?

275
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:56,978
That was a good party.

276
00:10:57,062 --> 00:10:59,814
Hey, didn't we get a cotton
candy machine for that party?

277
00:10:59,898 --> 00:11:02,317
Who told you Princess
Carolyn and I broke up?

278
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,069
- She did.
- What?

279
00:11:04,152 --> 00:11:05,695
You never took me home, jerk!

280
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:07,530
Oh, everything's my fault.

281
00:11:07,614 --> 00:11:09,199
Take me home.

282
00:11:09,283 --> 00:11:11,243
Okay, jeez.

283
00:11:11,326 --> 00:11:13,078
But I'm not looking for
parking in Silver Lake.

284
00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:14,370
I'll slow the car down to a crawl,

285
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:15,455
and you can duck and roll.

286
00:11:17,415 --> 00:11:19,709
You know what, you can take
a last look at this face,

287
00:11:19,793 --> 00:11:21,295
because it's the last
time you're gonna see it.

288
00:11:21,377 --> 00:11:22,378
Hey-up!

289
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:29,052
Hello?

290
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:30,470
I've got Princess Carolyn for you.

291
00:11:30,553 --> 00:11:31,972
Uh, okay.

292
00:11:32,055 --> 00:11:33,223
BoJack.

293
00:11:33,307 --> 00:11:34,808
Oh, my God, we just broke up.

294
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:36,476
Yeah, but I'm still your agent.

295
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,103
I pride myself on my ability

296
00:11:38,186 --> 00:11:40,688
to separate my professional
life from my personal life.

297
00:11:40,772 --> 00:11:41,815
Great.

298
00:11:41,982 --> 00:11:44,025
Then, as my agent, do
you think I'm getting fat?

299
00:11:44,109 --> 00:11:45,193
No way.

300
00:11:45,277 --> 00:11:47,445
You are in the prime of your
life, never looked better.

301
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:48,696
What about as my ex-girlfriend?

302
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,657
You look like a pile of crap
ate a second pile of crap

303
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,242
and then crapped out a third pile of crap.

304
00:11:52,326 --> 00:11:54,828
Wait, wait, so which pile
of crap do I look like?

305
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:56,746
- The third one.
- What? That's the worst one.

306
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,414
I'm not calling you as your ex.

307
00:11:58,498 --> 00:12:00,334
I'm calling you as your agent.

308
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,210
Remember that book you're
pretending to write?

309
00:12:02,294 --> 00:12:04,462
Well, Penguin wants an
update on your progress.

310
00:12:04,545 --> 00:12:05,880
Does Tuesday work for you,

311
00:12:05,964 --> 00:12:07,299
or are you gonna be too busy this week

312
00:12:07,382 --> 00:12:09,050
masturbating to old pictures of yourself?

313
00:12:09,134 --> 00:12:10,969
I told you, that's not what
was happening that time.

314
00:12:11,052 --> 00:12:13,554
I was masturbating to what
the picture represented.

315
00:12:13,638 --> 00:12:15,849
You walked in at the worst possible moment!

316
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:17,517
So, Tuesday, though?

317
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,643
Yes, fine!

318
00:12:20,603 --> 00:12:22,105
Whoo!

319
00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:23,690
You don't have anything?

320
00:12:23,773 --> 00:12:24,774
Hey, you got the electricity back.

321
00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:26,067
Good for you.

322
00:12:26,151 --> 00:12:27,277
This company is in dire straits.

323
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:30,613
We made a series of very bad investments.

324
00:12:30,697 --> 00:12:32,157
Ever hear of a young adult franchise

325
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,908
called the Swamp Monsters of Malibu?

326
00:12:33,992 --> 00:12:35,451
Uh, no.

327
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:41,333
Then why did we spend
$20 million on marketing?

328
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,127
It's okay, Pinky, go to your happy place.

329
00:12:44,211 --> 00:12:45,379
Uh...

330
00:12:45,461 --> 00:12:46,462
Look, I know you're a busy guy.

331
00:12:46,546 --> 00:12:47,547
Actually, I am a busy guy.

332
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,007
I live a very active lifestyle.

333
00:12:50,758 --> 00:12:53,220
Can't I just stay home with you?

334
00:12:53,303 --> 00:12:55,680
I know kindergarten is scary,

335
00:12:55,763 --> 00:12:57,682
but you're a big girl now,

336
00:12:57,765 --> 00:12:59,976
and you have to be brave.

337
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,477
Okay, Daddy.

338
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:06,149
Wait, did you just call me "Daddy"?

339
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:08,943
Little Sabrina grew up right
before our eyes, right, Todd?

340
00:13:09,027 --> 00:13:10,486
Todd?

341
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,571
Todd!

342
00:13:11,654 --> 00:13:12,864
What?

343
00:13:12,947 --> 00:13:14,782
Did Sabrina grow up before our eyes?

344
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:16,034
Yes!

345
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:18,578
We're tired of waiting.

346
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:20,747
We're hiring you a ghostwriter.

347
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,874
Diane "Nugent"?

348
00:13:22,957 --> 00:13:25,126
She's great, and she's
got a thing for horses.

349
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,170
Check this out.

350
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:28,880
Hey, Secretariat.

351
00:13:28,963 --> 00:13:30,506
You know, I always wanted to
play Secretariat in a movie.

352
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,133
He's kind of my personal hero.

353
00:13:32,217 --> 00:13:34,719
Could never get the project
off the ground, though.

354
00:13:34,802 --> 00:13:36,763
I mean, there was this one
time I came close in the '90s,

355
00:13:36,846 --> 00:13:38,514
but then those Prefontaine movies came out,

356
00:13:38,598 --> 00:13:40,475
and people got tired of
seeing running on-screen.

357
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:42,643
Don't tell me. Tell her!

358
00:13:42,727 --> 00:13:44,145
She's cute.

359
00:13:44,229 --> 00:13:46,398
Call her. That's a loan, by the way.

360
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:48,649
We can't afford to be giving
out free books to people,

361
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:50,277
but you can take anything you want

362
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,612
from the Swamp Monsters swag box.

363
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,120
Oh, God, I'm a failure.

364
00:14:00,203 --> 00:14:02,122
Oh, you're not a failure.

365
00:14:02,205 --> 00:14:03,623
Why did I say I could write a book?

366
00:14:03,706 --> 00:14:05,792
Because you have an amazing story to tell.

367
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,710
- Relax.
- Relax?

368
00:14:07,794 --> 00:14:09,212
Easy for you to say, you hippie.

369
00:14:09,296 --> 00:14:11,923
You've never had a day
of stress in your life.

370
00:14:12,006 --> 00:14:13,674
Ow. Why?

371
00:14:13,758 --> 00:14:17,512
And that's for trying to
sell E on the cartel's turf.

372
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:20,432
Oh, where's Gabriela?

373
00:14:20,515 --> 00:14:23,184
She went back to Mexico City, ese,

374
00:14:23,268 --> 00:14:25,395
to be with her husband.

375
00:14:25,479 --> 00:14:28,648
What? No!

376
00:14:30,275 --> 00:14:32,068
- Gabriela, why?
- Who?

377
00:14:32,152 --> 00:14:33,487
We were talking about me.

378
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:35,280
Can you try to focus for, like, a second?

379
00:14:35,363 --> 00:14:37,115
Oh, yeah, sorry. You were saying?

380
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:38,866
Never should have signed this book deal.

381
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:39,951
You know what my problem is?

382
00:14:40,034 --> 00:14:41,202
I can't say no to people

383
00:14:41,286 --> 00:14:42,703
because I want everyone to like me.

384
00:14:42,787 --> 00:14:46,249
You want everyone to like you?

385
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,625
Yeah, why?

386
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,002
Do people not like me?

387
00:14:49,085 --> 00:14:53,465
Uh...

388
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,136
Uh...

389
00:14:58,219 --> 00:14:59,387
What were we talking about?

390
00:14:59,471 --> 00:15:01,181
I can see the headline now,

391
00:15:01,264 --> 00:15:04,892
"Stupid BoJack writes a stupid
book about his stupid life,

392
00:15:04,976 --> 00:15:06,102
nobody cares."

393
00:15:06,186 --> 00:15:07,979
What newspapers are you reading?

394
00:15:08,062 --> 00:15:09,647
Hey, why don't you just let that lady

395
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,191
write your book and be done with it?

396
00:15:11,274 --> 00:15:12,900
Better question, why are you in my kitchen?

397
00:15:12,984 --> 00:15:13,985
I'm making breakfast.

398
00:15:14,068 --> 00:15:15,778
We had sex last night, dummy.

399
00:15:15,862 --> 00:15:17,447
Ugh, I really got to start putting my phone

400
00:15:17,531 --> 00:15:19,115
on airplane mode when I drink.

401
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:23,077
This lady probably thinks I'm
just some dumb sitcom actor.

402
00:15:23,161 --> 00:15:24,620
I hate her and her stupid,

403
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:26,331
impossible-to-pronounce
last name,

404
00:15:26,414 --> 00:15:27,874
Na-goo-ya-go-goo-goo-goo-ga.

405
00:15:27,957 --> 00:15:29,376
You haven't even met her.

406
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:30,835
Give her a chance.

407
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:32,587
Oh, you should invite her to the party.

408
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,713
What party?

409
00:15:33,796 --> 00:15:35,006
Why are you so obsessed

410
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:37,551
with throwing a party all of a sudden?

411
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:39,260
Ow, ow, ow!

412
00:15:39,344 --> 00:15:41,221
You know how much money
we lost 'cause of you?

413
00:15:41,304 --> 00:15:44,849
I can't even afford a hall now
for my daughter's 15th birthday,

414
00:15:44,932 --> 00:15:48,520
and now I got a hundred guests
coming and nowhere to put them.

415
00:15:48,603 --> 00:15:52,648
You owe me a party, cabrón,
and if you don't deliver...

416
00:15:56,152 --> 00:15:57,737
Because parties are fun?

417
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,447
This book is really important to me.

418
00:15:59,531 --> 00:16:00,948
I don't want to just hand
it off to some stranger.

419
00:16:01,032 --> 00:16:02,825
If it's so important, why have you written

420
00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:04,369
literally nothing in a year and a half?

421
00:16:04,452 --> 00:16:05,828
It's too much pressure.

422
00:16:05,912 --> 00:16:08,789
This book is my one shot
at preserving my legacy.

423
00:16:08,873 --> 00:16:10,917
I'm a joke, and if this book isn't good,

424
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,627
I'm gonna be a joke forever.

425
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,379
Everyone thinks that I'm
just this washed-up hack,

426
00:16:14,462 --> 00:16:16,130
but actually...

427
00:16:16,214 --> 00:16:18,716
Oh, God, actually, what if they're right?

428
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,635
I can't breathe.

429
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:21,802
Am I dying?

430
00:16:21,886 --> 00:16:24,055
Toast. I smell burning toast!

431
00:16:24,138 --> 00:16:26,724
Oh, my God, my toast!

432
00:16:26,807 --> 00:16:28,768
Todd, on my grave,

433
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:34,232
I want it to say that I was born in 1975.

434
00:16:34,315 --> 00:16:35,609
No one's gonna believe...

435
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:37,569
Damn it, can't you
respect a dying man's wish?

436
00:16:37,652 --> 00:16:39,153
You're not dying.

437
00:16:44,992 --> 00:16:47,621
Well, we did everything we could.

438
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:49,539
Nurse, record the time of death.

439
00:16:49,623 --> 00:16:51,541
It doesn't get easier.

440
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,126
It never gets easier.

441
00:16:57,046 --> 00:16:58,465
What... I don't...

442
00:16:58,548 --> 00:17:01,717
What do you mean he's dead?

443
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:03,428
That's right, sweetheart.

444
00:17:03,511 --> 00:17:05,305
He died of a broken heart

445
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:07,390
because you didn't appreciate him enough,

446
00:17:07,474 --> 00:17:09,350
and now he's gone forever.

447
00:17:09,434 --> 00:17:11,603
We might have gone too
dark on that series finale.

448
00:17:11,686 --> 00:17:12,853
I'm required to hand you over

449
00:17:12,937 --> 00:17:14,772
to the child protective services.

450
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,023
You're the state's problem now.

451
00:17:16,107 --> 00:17:18,610
No!

452
00:17:18,693 --> 00:17:21,195
Do you just take those DVDs
with you everywhere you go?

453
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,656
Linus walked around with a blanket.

454
00:17:22,738 --> 00:17:24,073
No one gave him shit for it.

455
00:17:24,157 --> 00:17:25,492
How long is that doctor going to take?

456
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:27,118
I have a meeting with
another client at 3:00.

457
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:28,495
You have other clients?

458
00:17:28,578 --> 00:17:30,746
No, I make a living off you
sitting on your ass all day.

459
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,749
Are your other clients
more talented than I am?

460
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,168
Your silence speaks volumes.

461
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,173
Well, BoJack, it looks
like what you experienced

462
00:17:40,256 --> 00:17:42,216
was a mild anxiety attack.

463
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,759
Jesus, if that's mild,

464
00:17:43,843 --> 00:17:46,179
I don't want to know what spicy feels like.

465
00:17:46,262 --> 00:17:47,472
Too smart for the room?

466
00:17:47,555 --> 00:17:48,806
It was a salsa joke, people.

467
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:50,308
You've been overstressed.

468
00:17:50,391 --> 00:17:52,310
I need you to take it easy.

469
00:17:52,393 --> 00:17:54,145
Take it easy, are you kidding?

470
00:17:54,228 --> 00:17:56,564
He doesn't have a job. He
has no real responsibilities.

471
00:17:56,648 --> 00:17:58,525
He doesn't do anything but take it easy.

472
00:17:58,608 --> 00:18:01,569
Well, can you take it even easier?

473
00:18:01,653 --> 00:18:04,238
I can try, doctor. I can try.

474
00:18:04,322 --> 00:18:06,491
This book deal is
obviously stressing you out.

475
00:18:06,574 --> 00:18:08,576
Will you just call the ghostwriter already?

476
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,830
What, you want me to call
this woman on the phone?

477
00:18:14,374 --> 00:18:17,043
Well, you just had another anxiety attack.

478
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:19,128
And Entertainment Weekly
said I wasn't consistent.

479
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,340
Really, not even a pity laugh?

480
00:18:22,423 --> 00:18:24,008
I did almost die.

481
00:18:24,091 --> 00:18:25,426
Ha.

482
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,845
I have to check on some other patients.

483
00:18:27,928 --> 00:18:29,263
You have other patients?

484
00:18:29,347 --> 00:18:31,474
BoJack, let's have a party, okay?

485
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:32,684
I'll organize the whole thing.

486
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:33,934
You can invite the ghostwriter

487
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:35,770
and have a nice, casual conversation

488
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:38,732
in a fun, pressure-free environment.

489
00:18:38,814 --> 00:18:40,734
Okay, fine. We'll have a party.

490
00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:42,235
Oh, thank God.

491
00:18:42,318 --> 00:18:43,778
But we're not getting
a cotton candy machine.

492
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:45,363
I can't control myself around those things.

493
00:18:45,446 --> 00:18:46,947
I totally hear what you are saying,

494
00:18:47,031 --> 00:18:49,116
and I will do my best.

495
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:06,384
Señor Horseman, I will never
forget your generosity today.

496
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:09,845
You have made a powerful ally for life.

497
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:11,723
Mwah. Let's dance!

498
00:19:11,806 --> 00:19:13,182
Todd, who was that guy?

499
00:19:13,266 --> 00:19:14,434
Who are all these people?

500
00:19:14,517 --> 00:19:16,060
Oh, you know, just a variety of folks

501
00:19:16,143 --> 00:19:17,144
from all walks of life.

502
00:19:17,228 --> 00:19:18,646
Is this a quinceañera?

503
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,565
Oh, so any party with Mexican teenage girls

504
00:19:20,648 --> 00:19:21,649
is a quinceañera?

505
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:23,192
Now who's racist?

506
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,323
I find that piñata offensive.

507
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,908
If you'll excuse me,

508
00:19:30,991 --> 00:19:34,537
I have a Virgin of
Guadalupe pendant to present.

509
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,585
BoJack!

510
00:19:40,668 --> 00:19:41,961
Oh, good Lord.

511
00:19:42,044 --> 00:19:44,297
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

512
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,966
Can you believe this, the
two of us in the same house?

513
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:48,968
Is this a crossover episode?

514
00:19:49,051 --> 00:19:51,345
No, I'm just kidding around, man.

515
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:53,640
Seriously, though, how are you?

516
00:19:53,723 --> 00:19:54,766
Well, I've been kind of up and...

517
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:56,601
Living the dream, huh? Yeah.

518
00:19:56,684 --> 00:19:58,519
Hey, we'll catch up later, all right?

519
00:19:58,603 --> 00:20:00,647
I want to talk to you.

520
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,107
Erica, how are you looking so beautiful?

521
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,275
I'm furious.

522
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:12,784
Hey, BoJack, right?

523
00:20:12,867 --> 00:20:15,202
- BoJack Horseman?
- Yes.

524
00:20:15,286 --> 00:20:17,622
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry, I don't
want to mispronounce your name.

525
00:20:17,705 --> 00:20:19,248
It's Diane.

526
00:20:19,332 --> 00:20:20,834
Oh, Diane.

527
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,627
Thanks for inviting me to your party.

528
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,919
Sorry I haven't really been mingling.

529
00:20:24,003 --> 00:20:26,172
I get kind of awkward at parties.

530
00:20:26,255 --> 00:20:28,090
- Have you tried alcohol?
- I don't know.

531
00:20:28,174 --> 00:20:32,011
Parties make me anxious
in a real broad sense.

532
00:20:32,094 --> 00:20:33,721
Like, look at that guy.

533
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:35,014
He's having fun.

534
00:20:35,097 --> 00:20:36,265
Why haven't I figured it out?

535
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:37,350
What guy?

536
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:38,726
No, there's no guy there.

537
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,020
I'm just saying, like, a guy, you know?

538
00:20:41,103 --> 00:20:42,438
Oh, okay, yeah.

539
00:20:42,522 --> 00:20:44,357
I'm probably just overthinking it

540
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,275
because I never got the practice

541
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:48,152
because I didn't get invited
to any parties in high school.

542
00:20:48,235 --> 00:20:50,029
What am I talking about?

543
00:20:50,112 --> 00:20:51,739
You don't care about any of that.

544
00:20:51,823 --> 00:20:53,199
Shut up, Diane.

545
00:20:53,282 --> 00:20:55,242
You're at a party, compliment the host.

546
00:20:55,326 --> 00:20:57,745
You have a lovely home.

547
00:20:57,829 --> 00:20:59,789
Yeah, well, if you're gonna throw away

548
00:20:59,873 --> 00:21:01,833
most of your adult life
on some dumb sitcom,

549
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,919
you might as well get a sweet
house out of the deal, right?

550
00:21:05,002 --> 00:21:07,296
So what are you working on these days?

551
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,715
Well, mostly I just sit around the house

552
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:09,924
and complain about things.

553
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:12,009
Yeah, how's that working out for you?

554
00:21:12,092 --> 00:21:13,928
I can't complain, so you know.

555
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:16,305
No, I will not have sex with you!

556
00:21:16,389 --> 00:21:18,641
This girl wants me to have sex with her.

557
00:21:18,725 --> 00:21:20,476
No, I'm just kidding around.

558
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,061
You're a good sport.

559
00:21:22,144 --> 00:21:24,313
- Ugh, you know who that is?
- Mr. Peanutbutter?

560
00:21:24,397 --> 00:21:26,649
Yeah, he was on that show
Mr. Peanutbutter's House

561
00:21:26,733 --> 00:21:29,360
about that dog who adopted
the three human kids.

562
00:21:29,443 --> 00:21:32,279
What a dumb idea for a TV show.

563
00:21:32,363 --> 00:21:34,699
You people are all right.

564
00:21:34,782 --> 00:21:36,158
Who wants an autograph?

565
00:21:36,242 --> 00:21:37,660
He's so stupid he doesn't realize

566
00:21:37,744 --> 00:21:40,162
how miserable he should be. I envy that.

567
00:21:40,246 --> 00:21:42,623
Hey, do you know the story of
the dad from The Brady Bunch?

568
00:21:42,707 --> 00:21:43,999
Do I know his story?

569
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,334
If I recall correctly,

570
00:21:45,418 --> 00:21:46,419
he was bringing up three boys of his own.

571
00:21:46,502 --> 00:21:47,628
Right, but...

572
00:21:47,712 --> 00:21:48,755
They were four men living all together,

573
00:21:48,838 --> 00:21:49,839
but they were all alone.

574
00:21:49,964 --> 00:21:51,799
That is profoundly sad.

575
00:21:51,883 --> 00:21:54,928
No, the story is that
the guy who played the dad

576
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:58,222
hated being on The Brady Bunch
because he was a real actor,

577
00:21:58,305 --> 00:21:59,974
and he considered it beneath him.

578
00:22:00,057 --> 00:22:01,392
Sound familiar?

579
00:22:01,475 --> 00:22:03,269
That's not all that was beneath him.

580
00:22:03,352 --> 00:22:05,563
Gay joke. Sorry, I'm better than that.

581
00:22:05,646 --> 00:22:07,398
Most people don't even get to do

582
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:08,942
The Brady Bunch version

583
00:22:09,024 --> 00:22:10,568
of the thing they want
to do with their lives.

584
00:22:10,651 --> 00:22:12,862
You're actually in a
really good position now,

585
00:22:12,946 --> 00:22:14,822
because you can pretty
much do anything you want.

586
00:22:14,906 --> 00:22:16,616
You're responsible for your
own happiness, you know?

587
00:22:16,699 --> 00:22:18,826
- Good Lord, that's depressing.
- No, it's not.

588
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,536
I'm responsible for my own happiness?

589
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,705
I can't even be responsible
for my own breakfast.

590
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,548
Todd!

591
00:22:32,632 --> 00:22:33,800
I need help.

592
00:22:33,883 --> 00:22:36,469
What would make you happy?

593
00:22:36,552 --> 00:22:38,304
Well, finishing my memoir, I guess.

594
00:22:38,387 --> 00:22:40,347
Is that all? I can help you with that.

595
00:22:40,431 --> 00:22:42,600
Yeah? I mean, would you even want to?

596
00:22:42,683 --> 00:22:44,184
You'd have to spend a lot of time with me.

597
00:22:44,268 --> 00:22:45,603
You'd probably get sick of me.

598
00:22:45,686 --> 00:22:47,146
I don't think that's going to happen.

599
00:22:47,229 --> 00:22:49,148
- No?
- No, BoJack.

600
00:22:49,231 --> 00:22:50,775
Okay.

601
00:22:50,858 --> 00:22:52,610
Well, then I guess you're hired,

602
00:22:52,693 --> 00:22:54,946
but don't put all that stuff
about how sad I am in the book.

603
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:56,238
Oh, that doesn't count.

604
00:22:56,322 --> 00:22:57,406
We weren't on the clock yet.

605
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,866
Yeah, exactly.

606
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:04,330
You're only my ghostwriter starting nah...

607
00:23:04,413 --> 00:23:05,999
- Starting now.
- You got it.

608
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:08,001
- BoJack!
- Ugh, this guy.

609
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:09,877
Hey, man, wanted to let you know,

610
00:23:09,961 --> 00:23:11,462
you are out of beer.

611
00:23:11,545 --> 00:23:12,797
Oh, I see you've met

612
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,423
my beautiful girlfriend, Diane Nguyen.

613
00:23:14,507 --> 00:23:15,925
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second.

614
00:23:16,009 --> 00:23:17,176
You drank all my beer?

615
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:19,219
- Also, you two are dating?
- Yeah.

616
00:23:19,303 --> 00:23:21,014
- You're dating him?
- Yes.

617
00:23:21,096 --> 00:23:22,181
This is your boyfriend?

618
00:23:22,264 --> 00:23:23,599
- That is correct.
- Uh-huh.

619
00:23:23,683 --> 00:23:25,559
- You are going out with you?
- Uh-huh.

620
00:23:25,643 --> 00:23:27,269
But in a sexual way, not just as friends?

621
00:23:27,353 --> 00:23:28,688
- That's right.
- You have seen her naked.

622
00:23:28,771 --> 00:23:29,981
Many times, yes.

623
00:23:30,064 --> 00:23:31,440
- You are attracted to this?
- Yes.

624
00:23:31,524 --> 00:23:33,233
This penis has been inside this vagina.

625
00:23:33,317 --> 00:23:34,360
- Yep.
- But in a sexual way.

626
00:23:34,443 --> 00:23:36,737
Oh, yes.

627
00:23:36,821 --> 00:23:37,947
Humph.

628
00:23:40,574 --> 00:23:41,993
- Ugh.
- Oh, my God.

629
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,788
Are you okay?

630
00:23:45,872 --> 00:23:46,873
I'm just...

631
00:23:46,956 --> 00:23:49,750
I'm fine.

632
00:23:49,834 --> 00:23:51,460
I'm just... I'm really happy for you.

633
00:23:52,628 --> 00:23:54,338
Should we get someone, or...

634
00:23:54,421 --> 00:23:55,965
No, everything's...

635
00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:57,884
Oh, this is really...

636
00:23:57,967 --> 00:23:59,426
Wonderful.

637
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,594
Oh, God.

638
00:24:03,514 --> 00:24:05,766
Starting now.
