1
00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:08,442
This is from BoJack H.
BoJack is nine years old.

2
00:00:08,526 --> 00:00:12,112
"When I grow up, I want to be like you.
I'm on the right track.

3
00:00:12,196 --> 00:00:15,950
Get it? Track? Because horses
run on tracks and you are a horse.

4
00:00:16,034 --> 00:00:19,411
And I am a horse. Do you get it?
Do you get my joke about the track?"

5
00:00:19,495 --> 00:00:23,082
- There's a whole page of this.
- Should I write him, tell him I get it?

6
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:25,125
He goes on. "My question for you is:

7
00:00:25,209 --> 00:00:27,503
I am a good kid and I like to play,

8
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:30,589
and I like to go to school,
but sometimes I get sad.

9
00:00:30,673 --> 00:00:33,425
What do you do when you get sad?
How do you not be sad?"

10
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:36,554
Oh, big stud, running off
to gallivant with your fillies.

11
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:40,516
Is that to impress me?
I can smash a dinner plate, too.

12
00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:42,309
That's a salad plate.

13
00:00:42,393 --> 00:00:44,353
I thought these were salad plates.

14
00:00:44,436 --> 00:00:47,523
- Those are saucers.
- Why do we even have saucers?

15
00:00:47,606 --> 00:00:49,067
We don't drink tea.

16
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,569
Those saucers are for entertaining!

17
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:54,822
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm exit-taining.

18
00:00:54,906 --> 00:00:56,198
Do you get it?

19
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,619
But, uh, seriously, folks.
Right?

20
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,959
Don't sit so close to the TV,
it'll make you cruel.

21
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:11,589
You know, I was beautiful

22
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,841
- before I got pregnant.
- I know.

23
00:01:14,592 --> 00:01:18,054
- You ruined me, BoJack.
- I know.

24
00:01:18,137 --> 00:01:22,100
You better grow up to be something great
to make up for all the damage you've done.

25
00:01:22,558 --> 00:01:24,018
I will.

26
00:01:24,102 --> 00:01:26,437
...and I just kept running. BoJack...

27
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,231
Okay, enough me being a great mom.

28
00:01:29,314 --> 00:01:31,567
I'm gonna go hide
your father's heart medication.

29
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,486
Enjoy your dumb little TV show.

30
00:02:30,876 --> 00:02:35,422
The first thing is,
you gotta believe that change is possible.

31
00:02:35,547 --> 00:02:37,842
You have to tell yourself every day:

32
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:40,845
"I can change and I will change."

33
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:44,264
- I can change and I will change.
- Louder.

34
00:02:44,348 --> 00:02:46,558
I can change and I will change.

35
00:02:46,642 --> 00:02:49,645
- Still can't hear you.
- You're an audiobook.

36
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,939
"I've got a new attitude."

37
00:02:52,023 --> 00:02:56,068
That's what your face should be saying
to everyone you pass on the street.

38
00:02:56,485 --> 00:02:58,821
We call that the PANTS approach.

39
00:02:58,904 --> 00:03:01,406
P-A-N-T-S.

40
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,450
People all need to see.

41
00:03:03,534 --> 00:03:05,953
People all need to see.

42
00:03:06,037 --> 00:03:08,497
Yeah, a little to the right.
No, house right.

43
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,583
That's an acting term.
It means left. I'm an actor.

44
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:16,380
No.

45
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:21,426
- BoJack, why did I wake up in an alley?
- I had to get rid of the old couch, Todd.

46
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,012
While I was sleeping on it?

47
00:03:23,095 --> 00:03:25,305
The couch was a metaphor
for my old attitude.

48
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:29,018
My audiobook told me I had to let go
of the burdens of my life sofa.

49
00:03:29,101 --> 00:03:31,645
Oh, you know what?
Maybe it was "my life so far."

50
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:33,939
I feel like
you could've woken me up first.

51
00:03:34,023 --> 00:03:37,442
Todd, no one can wake anybody else up.
You need to wake yourself up.

52
00:03:38,277 --> 00:03:42,156
I don't know if I trust this new guy.
I'm just gonna go sleep in your car.

53
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,909
- Uh-oh. I think someone needs a FAB.
- A FAB?

54
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:47,036
FAB, stands for fresh active BNA.

55
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:50,206
- BNA?
- Brand-new attitude. Try to keep up.

56
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:52,083
ATTITUDE stands for attention to--

57
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,877
Did you also get rid of my stuff?
Where's my duffel bag?

58
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:57,755
I value you.
Hashtag "thank you for being a friend."

59
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,339
Hashtag "PANTS."

60
00:04:01,092 --> 00:04:03,510
You got to conquer that hill.

61
00:04:03,594 --> 00:04:05,387
The hill is a metaphor.

62
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,848
Everything is a metaphor.

63
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:11,351
- You are literally a metaphor.
- Oh, my God.

64
00:04:11,435 --> 00:04:13,020
Oh, my God, this is the worst.

65
00:04:13,104 --> 00:04:14,605
This feels awful.

66
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:15,981
Why does anybody run?

67
00:04:16,065 --> 00:04:18,067
On your right.

68
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:25,199
And she had no idea
that her boyfriend was the strangler.

69
00:04:25,283 --> 00:04:28,286
I guess some people just see what
they wanna see, right, Vincent?

70
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,494
Um...

71
00:04:29,578 --> 00:04:31,789
- Yeah.
- Hey, Princess Carolyn.

72
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,083
I gotta go.
One of my dumb-ass clients is here.

73
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:37,419
Just out for a jog, thought I'd say hello.
I jog now.

74
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,171
You jogged here from Laurel Canyon?

75
00:04:39,255 --> 00:04:42,466
I drove, but I moved my arm a bunch,
so the Fitbit counted the miles.

76
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:46,386
Uh, someone named BoJark Hoseman
is here?

77
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,473
- Thank you, Stuart.
- Also, your coffee is coming late.

78
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,143
- Just like you ordered.
- I said "latte."

79
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:55,479
Ah. Well, I wrote down "late,"
so that's what it's gonna be.

80
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:59,608
- What happened to Laura?
- Assistants are like Belushi brothers.

81
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:02,111
Good ones leave too soon,
bad ones never go away.

82
00:05:02,194 --> 00:05:05,530
It's a beautiful day, though, right?
Every morning is a miracle.

83
00:05:05,614 --> 00:05:07,574
Hashtag "miracle."

85
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:14,665
I'm glad you found your bliss, but are you
ready for your first day on set tomorrow?

86
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:17,960
You mean, am I amped?
Because I am so pumped.

87
00:05:18,043 --> 00:05:20,171
This Secretariat movie is a big deal.

88
00:05:20,296 --> 00:05:22,298
Please do not blow it.

89
00:05:22,381 --> 00:05:25,384
Why would I blow it?
I have a brand-new attitude.

90
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:29,513
You know, when I won that Golden Globe
last month, I went to a very dark place.

91
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:30,806
I was in a hole.

92
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:34,476
And I realized, "I can wallow
in this hole or I can change."

93
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:38,480
While I was tempted to go with the former,
sometimes the only way out of a hole

94
00:05:38,563 --> 00:05:39,815
is a latter.

95
00:05:39,898 --> 00:05:42,276
- No pun intended.
- You clearly intended that pun.

96
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,280
Princess Carolyn,
you gotta believe in the AHP of TPE.

97
00:05:46,364 --> 00:05:47,239
Huh.

98
00:05:47,323 --> 00:05:50,117
- Uh-uh. I'm not asking.
- The awesome healing power--

99
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:52,452
- I am not asking.
- --of total positive energy.

100
00:05:52,536 --> 00:05:55,580
You should leave because
I'm about to pretend to get a phone call.

101
00:05:55,664 --> 00:05:58,417
Hello?
No, he's still here.

102
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,919
- No, he's not taking the hint somehow.
- Mm-hm.

103
00:06:03,505 --> 00:06:06,425
Honey, where's my bandana?

104
00:06:06,508 --> 00:06:08,927
You chewed it up,
we had to throw it away, remember?

105
00:06:09,011 --> 00:06:11,263
No, not that one.

106
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:12,890
The one with the bones on it.

107
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:15,600
With the meat juice stains?
The one I wore to the Emmys.

108
00:06:15,684 --> 00:06:18,729
I don't know. I gotta go.
BoJack's gonna be here any minute.

109
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,439
Did you check the hall closet?

110
00:06:20,522 --> 00:06:23,442
I can't see anything in this stupid thing.

111
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:25,194
I know, Mr. Peanutbutter.

112
00:06:25,277 --> 00:06:27,612
But you gotta keep it on
for one more week.

113
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:33,202
I look like an idiot.

114
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:35,371
You look very responsible.

115
00:06:35,454 --> 00:06:37,706
Is the bandana doing anything?

116
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,253
Hey, work buddy,
first day on the job, huh?

117

at a new job, sincerely, BoJack."

118

- @Diane.
- Can't believe you wanted to carpool.

119
00:06:48,592 --> 00:06:51,803
- Gotta save the planet, Diane.
- Hey, is that BoJack Horseman?

120
00:06:51,887 --> 00:06:55,515
I don't know because I have no peripheral
vision. Going off of smell here.

121
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,601
Mr. Peanutbutter, how the hell are you?

122
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:01,105
- Loving it, buddy. Loving life.
- Brother, I am right there with you.

123
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:03,774
I got a brand-new attitude
and I am also loving life.

124
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:04,691
Uh...

125
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:07,694
Diane, look at us.
A couple life-lovers over here.

126
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:10,572
- Uh...
- Is that a new cone? Looking sharp, PB.

127
00:07:10,655 --> 00:07:13,451
It is a new cone.
Is it obvious I'm wearing a cone?

128
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,953
Didn't notice.
You've got the smile of a winner.

129
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:18,205
- What's going on?
- I have to wear the cone

130
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:22,334
so I don't gnaw on the stitches I had
to get when I punched a mirror last week.

131
00:07:22,418 --> 00:07:25,629
I got drunk and thought my reflection
was another dog.

132
00:07:25,754 --> 00:07:28,048
I was so mad at that other dog.

133
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:29,800
He was wearing my clothes.

134
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:32,886
- We've all been there.
- I don't understand what's happening.

135
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,931
Did someone say something to the left?
Diane, is that you?

136
00:07:36,014 --> 00:07:38,850
Hey, why don't we just us two schedj
a hang for this 'kend?

137
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:40,478
"'Kend" is how I say weekend now.

138
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,982
Uh, I love that. And I got a pair of tix
to the 'Stones show this 'kend.

139
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,817
- Wanna go?
- The Rolling Stones?

140
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,695
What? Oh, no, no, no.
The Mighty Mighty Bosstones.

141
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:54,366
I'm not really familiar with that outfit,
but I do love trying new things.

142
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,952
- Who are you?
- Anyway, we gotta get to work.

143
00:07:57,035 --> 00:07:59,579
It was really great talking to you,
Mr. Peanutbutter.

144
00:07:59,704 --> 00:08:04,084
All right, break a leg, good buddy.
Diane, BoJack's ready to go.

145
00:08:04,168 --> 00:08:06,337
Where are you, sweetheart?
Are you ready?

146
00:08:06,462 --> 00:08:09,256
The house is a metaphor for a home.

147
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,468
Happiness is a metaphor for change.

148
00:08:12,551 --> 00:08:14,345
Happiness is a metaphor--

149
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:16,805
- Where are we going?
- Oh, my God.

150
00:08:21,226 --> 00:08:25,063
BoJack, this is Corduroy
Jackson-Jackson, your costar.

151
00:08:25,147 --> 00:08:28,108
- Hey, man.
- Corduroy Jackson-Jackson.

152
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:29,943
Oh, right, the underwear guy.

153
00:08:30,027 --> 00:08:35,157
Underwear model/actor/dancer/dreamer.

154
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,119
Also, you know, I'm a huge fan.
I'm so excited/amped/pumped

155
00:08:39,203 --> 00:08:41,580
to be working with you.
Yeah.

156
00:08:41,663 --> 00:08:46,001
Hey, man, that's
fantastic/great/I-ran-out-of-things.

157
00:08:46,084 --> 00:08:48,670
- Hi. Kelsey Jannings?
- That depends.

158
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:51,089
- Are you my ex-wife's lawyer?
- I'm Diane.

159
00:08:51,173 --> 00:08:53,633
I'm here to be a character consultant.

160
00:08:53,717 --> 00:08:55,719
- What?
- I got a call from the studio.

161
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:59,973
Okay. Why don't you stand over there and
make sure no one trips over that cable?

162
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:02,518
- This cable?
- Do you have a thousand dollars?

163
00:09:02,601 --> 00:09:04,144
- What?
- Because each minute

164
00:09:04,228 --> 00:09:07,189
I spend talking to you,
that's how much money I'm wasting.

165
00:09:07,272 --> 00:09:08,857
- Oh. Sorry.
- Hey, who's this guy?

166
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,442
- Who let this guy in?
- I just--

167
00:09:10,526 --> 00:09:12,486
He's got a funny face. I like your face.

168
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,530
- Thank you.
- What a cute funny face. Cookie?

169
00:09:14,613 --> 00:09:16,323
Can someone get this guy a cookie?

170
00:09:16,407 --> 00:09:18,700
He's got a soothing face
and I like looking at it.

171
00:09:18,783 --> 00:09:20,660
- Like a Matisse painting.
- Whoa.

172
00:09:20,744 --> 00:09:22,913
Guys, could I get
everyone's attention, please?

173
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,665
Oh, watch out for the cable.
Don't trip over the cable.

174
00:09:25,749 --> 00:09:28,668
I just want everyone to know
what an honor it is to be here.

175
00:09:28,793 --> 00:09:31,880
Secretariat has always been
a personal hero of mine.

176
00:09:31,963 --> 00:09:35,050
A complex role that requires
a precise touch and a deft hand

177
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:37,928
and I just can't wait to tackle it
head-on.

178
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,638
It's truly an honor.

179
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:41,473
Namaste.

180
00:09:43,601 --> 00:09:46,937
Neat. So, in this scene,
Secretariat's at his lowest.

181
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,315
He just lost his first race,
his father was sent to the glue factory.

182
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,942
It's a dark moment.

183
00:09:52,443 --> 00:09:56,363
- You got it.
- Scene 22 alpha, take one.

184
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:00,825
- Action!
- Hey, Secretariat.

185
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,083
What are you doing here?

186
00:10:17,635 --> 00:10:19,844
- Hello?
- Diane!

187
00:10:19,928 --> 00:10:22,097
I can't tell you how disappointed I am

188
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,225
you're not here with me
in Northern Cordovia.

189
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:27,436
I'm incredibly disappointed. Boo!

190
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,063
I didn't think I could do it,
but I did it.

191
00:10:30,147 --> 00:10:32,023
I'm amazing.

192
00:10:32,107 --> 00:10:34,443
Sebastian,
I know you're doing important work.

193
00:10:34,526 --> 00:10:37,321
I couldn't just drop everything
and fly to the Third World.

194
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:39,573
- I just got married, and--
- Diane.

195
00:10:39,657 --> 00:10:41,741
People are dying, and I'm witnessing it.

196
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:45,036
And I need people
to witness me witnessing it.

197
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,207
I know, and I'll be there in three months,
as soon as I'm done on the movie.

198
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,459
This is also important.

199
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:52,877
In a way.

200
00:10:53,003 --> 00:10:56,006
Well, lucky for you,
there'll still be just as much famine

201
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:59,009
and war and devastation
in three months.

202
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,427
I'm not dead yet.

203
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:03,972
- Yep. Lucky me.
- We're still rolling, people.

204
00:11:04,055 --> 00:11:07,267
So, BoJack, in this scene,
Secretariat is sad, right?

205
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:09,186
Afraid he's gonna lose his scholarship.

206
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,980
Oh, sure. Yeah, sad. Of course. Duh.

207
00:11:12,063 --> 00:11:14,149
Okay, here we go. Action.

208
00:11:14,232 --> 00:11:15,442
Hey, Secretariat.

209
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:17,736
What are you doing here?

210
00:11:19,154 --> 00:11:21,906
That was bad. I know that was bad.
Let's keep it rolling.

211
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,908
- I'll say when to keep rolling.
- Okay.

212
00:11:23,992 --> 00:11:28,038
What are you doing here? Did we get it?
I can tell by your face that we didn't.

213
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,541
All right, let me try again.
What are you doing--?

214
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:34,503
I am having trouble with the words.
Is it okay if I play around with it a bit?

215
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:38,256
When did you get here?
Sorry, no. Got it. Got it. Got it.

216
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,175
Man, these lights are bright, huh?

217
00:11:40,258 --> 00:11:42,678
Can we kill these lights at all?
Is that a--?

218
00:11:42,761 --> 00:11:44,346
- No.
- Okay, I'm sad.

219
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:46,139
I'm sad. Acting sad.

220
00:11:46,223 --> 00:11:48,350
Secretariat is sad.

221
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:49,601
Okay, here we go.

222
00:11:49,685 --> 00:11:51,311
I'm sad!

223
00:11:51,395 --> 00:11:52,604
Sorry, what was the line?

224
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:56,734
I don't know if this helps or not,
but when Secretariat was a kid

225
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,443
- he actually--
- Aah!

226
00:11:58,694 --> 00:11:59,944
- My face!
- Hey, hey.

227
00:12:00,028 --> 00:12:01,739
- Whoa, whoa!
- Oh, my God.

228
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,114
- Watch out!
- Hey.

229
00:12:03,198 --> 00:12:05,158
Whoa, whoa!

230
00:12:05,242 --> 00:12:07,786
Oh, my God. My face.

231
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:09,538
My beautiful face.

232
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:12,666
Why didn't someone tell me
not to trip over that cable?

233
00:12:13,124 --> 00:12:17,003
It was such an important job,
but no one was there to do it

234
00:12:17,128 --> 00:12:19,923
and now my face is in ruins.

235
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:22,634
We're gonna need a couple of days
to rebuild this set.

236
00:12:22,718 --> 00:12:25,887
So, let's all just use this time
to regroup

237
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,683
and really figure out what we're doing

238
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:32,102
and why we're here.

239
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:41,236
So, let me get this straight.
Bad means good?

240
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:45,073
Maybe you should leave the teen-talk
to me. Jeezy Kableezy.

241
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,414
Well, it wasn't Ibsen.

242
00:12:52,497 --> 00:12:56,376
That's your takeaway?
That your son's TV show wasn't Ibsen?

243
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,878
I'm sorry. Did you need a compliment?

244
00:12:59,003 --> 00:13:02,549
Oh, I loved the part where you got
your head caught in the banister.

245
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:04,593
- Yeah--
- And what's this letter I have?

246
00:13:04,676 --> 00:13:07,679
It's from the government saying,
"I'm proud of you."

247
00:13:07,763 --> 00:13:10,766
- Are you--?
- No, what I'm holding is nothing.

248
00:13:10,849 --> 00:13:13,477
Can you check on our drinks?
I would love some gin.

249
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,230
I wouldn't drink anything out of an open
container. This town is full of AIDS.

250
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:19,566
- That's not--
- You're a clown, you know that?

251
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,610
You've always been a pillar of support.

252
00:13:21,693 --> 00:13:23,320
Gin, please? Is there gin coming?

253
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,989
I'm here, aren't I?
I suffered through that ordeal.

254
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:28,784
You know, the man sitting next to me
was wearing a T-shirt?

255
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:31,578
A T-shirt, BoJack, in the theater.

256
00:13:31,662 --> 00:13:32,788
Yes, a T-shirt.

257
00:13:32,871 --> 00:13:35,540
Worst thing that's happened to anyone
in a theater.

258
00:13:35,624 --> 00:13:38,794
- The T-shirt told me to "just do it."
- Here we go.

259
00:13:38,877 --> 00:13:41,296
I don't know to what "it"
the T-shirt referred

260
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,382
but I won't be spoken to in that tone
by an article of clothing.

261
00:13:44,466 --> 00:13:46,718
Vodka? Triple sec?
Looking for any alcohol.

262
00:13:46,802 --> 00:13:48,595
You don't know how lucky you are.

263
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:52,474
I hope you die before I do so you never
know what it's like to lose a mother.

264
00:13:52,557 --> 00:13:54,685
As long as one of us dies,
that's good enough.

265
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:59,397
Can we please get some alcohol
into my mouth?

266
00:13:59,481 --> 00:14:01,775
The past is past.

267
00:14:01,859 --> 00:14:04,319
That's why it's called the past.

268
00:14:04,736 --> 00:14:06,822
Tomorrow is an opportunity.

269
00:14:06,905 --> 00:14:10,659
You can be big and proud
and bang on your tom-tom drum

270
00:14:10,742 --> 00:14:14,120
or you can get in your boat and row.

271
00:14:14,245 --> 00:14:16,331
Tom or row.

272
00:14:16,414 --> 00:14:17,875
Tomorrow.

273
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,794
- Hey, do you wanna talk?
- Talk? Why? Why would we do that?

274
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:23,755
So you can put everything
in a book and sell a million copies?

275
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,131
Wow. Uh...

276
00:14:25,215 --> 00:14:28,092
That's what the old me would have said.
The new me doesn't hold a grudge.

277
00:14:29,093 --> 00:14:30,846
- No.
- I gotta say,

278
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:33,264
the new you seems a little on edge.

279
00:14:33,348 --> 00:14:35,975
What? Me?
I'm as cool as The Fonz in a meat locker.

280
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:37,602
That's a metaphor, Diane.

281
00:14:37,686 --> 00:14:39,103
- It's a simile.
- Goddamn it.

282
00:14:40,104 --> 00:14:41,857
Oh, okay. Hello?

283
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,568
Small talk, small talk, small talk.
Are you blowing it?

284
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:48,112
- I heard you're blowing it.
- What? Who told you that? Was it Todd?

285
00:14:48,196 --> 00:14:50,824
You gotta turn this ship around, BoJ.
If you don't--

286
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:53,660
Hey, can you hold on a second?
I'm getting another call.

287
00:14:53,744 --> 00:14:58,998
Well, if it isn't my friend, Rutabaga,
the boy prince of the 26th floor.

288
00:14:59,082 --> 00:15:02,878
Carolyn.
How are things all the way up on 27?

289
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:06,047
Stomp once for good, twice for killing it.

290
00:15:06,965 --> 00:15:09,008
Killing...

291
00:15:09,092 --> 00:15:10,427
Give me some gossip.

292
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,971
My wife is making me go
to the opera tonight.

293
00:15:13,054 --> 00:15:15,807
I need something to distract me
from the thought of D-bags

294
00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:18,184
singing songs in German
about their boners.

295
00:15:18,268 --> 00:15:20,395
Okay, you gotta
keep this close to the vest

296
00:15:20,478 --> 00:15:23,481
but I am inches
from getting Emily VanCamp

297
00:15:23,565 --> 00:15:27,485
the lead in Goose Van Sant's
new movie about Jackie O.

298
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:32,616
My clients would f-l-ip
if I got them parts like that.

299
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,243
You're killing it
in the department of kicking ass

300
00:15:35,326 --> 00:15:38,705
in regards to you being an agent
and being good at it, crushing it.

301
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:41,959
You're not so bad yourself, Rutabaga,
for a 26er.

302
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,462
You're the only one in this building
who isn't a total snooze-cooze.

303
00:15:45,587 --> 00:15:49,674
Yes, Natasha, I'm talking about you.
I know you're listening.

304
00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:52,469
Ugh. I gotta go. I made Natasha cry.

305
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,473
I don't think she's coming back.

306
00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:59,768
Could we keep it down
in the front, please?

307
00:15:59,851 --> 00:16:01,728
- Thank you.
- What am I gonna do?

308
00:16:01,812 --> 00:16:06,024
Well, you were an actor for nine years
on Horsin' Around. How did you do that?

309
00:16:06,107 --> 00:16:07,191
Uh...

310
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,320
- Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Of course, buddy.

311
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:13,323
I always have time for you,
my good friend BoJack

312
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,116
in this, the year 1988.

313
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,034
Have a seat.

314
00:16:17,201 --> 00:16:20,789
Hey, enough with the stomping already!

315
00:16:21,456 --> 00:16:25,043
- Am I-- Am I a clown?
- Oh, brother.

316
00:16:25,126 --> 00:16:27,754
Didn't I tell you not to invite your mom
to the taping?

317
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:32,342
As Max Headroom would say,
"Your m-m-mom is a b-b-bitch."

318
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,385
But I am a good actor, right?

319
00:16:34,469 --> 00:16:38,431
BJ, I don't know. Look--
You know what you're good at?

320
00:16:38,515 --> 00:16:42,393
Hitting your mark, saying your lines,
loudly with good diction.

321
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:44,938
Should I be doing more?
To capture the character

322
00:16:45,022 --> 00:16:48,232
- and make the audience connect?
- This is a situation comedy.

323
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:52,487
No one watches this show to feel feelings.
Life is depressing enough already.

324
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,781
You bring joy to millions of people.

325
00:16:54,865 --> 00:16:58,952
Maybe someday later,
you'll need to learn how to act for real.

326
00:16:59,036 --> 00:17:02,664
But for now,
don't worry about it.

327
00:17:03,081 --> 00:17:06,125
Oh, shit. I'm not an actor.

328
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:09,796
All this time, I assumed there was more
to me than everyone thought

329
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:11,297
but maybe there isn't.

330
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,718
That's the part where you're supposed
to disagree with me.

331
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,260
Oh, right.

332
00:17:16,344 --> 00:17:20,264
Well, you got the part, didn't you?
What did you do in the audition?

333
00:17:20,348 --> 00:17:22,392
Well, how should I know?
That was the old me.

334
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:25,478
Now I've got a brand-new attitude.

335
00:17:25,562 --> 00:17:28,523
Oh, God. Okay. Okay.
What should I do?

336
00:17:28,606 --> 00:17:30,441
Make a break for it? Drive to Mexico?

337
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:33,319
Start a new life there?
Meet a local girl? Fall in love?

338
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:35,572
Talk my way into a job at a textile plant?

339
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,490
Work my way up until I own the place?

340
00:17:37,574 --> 00:17:39,993
What am I talking about?
I can't run a textile plant.

341
00:17:40,077 --> 00:17:43,413
Too much responsibility. What am I
gonna do? The walls are closing in!

342
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:46,290
BoJack, breathe. You can do this.

343
00:17:46,374 --> 00:17:49,586
You have two days.
Maybe you could hire an acting coach.

344
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:50,879
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

345
00:17:50,962 --> 00:17:53,339
Plus, you can watch old
Secretariat videos.

346
00:17:53,423 --> 00:17:55,967
I've got a hard drive full of research.

347
00:17:56,051 --> 00:17:58,929
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
You're right. I can do this.

348
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:00,430
I've got two whole days.

349
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:03,224
And when the pressure's on,
that's when I shine.

350
00:18:03,307 --> 00:18:07,104
Yeah. Two days.
I can do all those things.

351
00:18:08,897 --> 00:18:11,274
Oh, shit. I didn't do any of those things.

352
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,237
- What are you doing here?
- Ah!

353
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,197
That was it. Say that again.

354
00:18:18,281 --> 00:18:20,575
What are you doing here?

355
00:18:20,658 --> 00:18:21,952
- Okay.
- No?

356
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:23,411
BoJack, before we get started

357
00:18:23,494 --> 00:18:25,246
- I wanted to show you this.
- What?

358
00:18:25,329 --> 00:18:27,999
This is the machine
that's gonna make you a good actor.

359
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,919
- Really?
- No. We need to make a scan of your face

360
00:18:31,002 --> 00:18:33,588
so that if you die,
we can finish the movie.

361
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:37,216
Standard procedure. When a star
is assessed to be of a certain liability,

362
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,387
like if there was a whole book written
about what a reckless jackass he is,

363
00:18:41,471 --> 00:18:45,767
you make a digital replica so you're
not screwed if he goes all Belushi on you.

364
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,352
- Wait, which Belushi?
- Hold still, please.

365
00:18:50,438 --> 00:18:53,733
- Terrific. We got it.
- One day, that's gonna be the job.

366
00:18:53,817 --> 00:18:56,402
Sit for five seconds
while a machine scans his face.

367
00:18:56,486 --> 00:18:58,655
Six months later,
plugging a movie on Kimmel.

368
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:01,825
I gotta go on Kimmel now?
What if he makes me read a mean tweet?

369
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:03,367
I'm not emotionally prepared.

370
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:05,703
Don't worry so much.
If you can't do this part

371
00:19:05,787 --> 00:19:09,874
we'll just fire you and get someone else
who can. Either way, I'll be fine.

372
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,961
What do you need, BoJack?

373
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:17,007
I don't know. I thought I wanted this,
but now I'm feeling all this pressure.

374
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:20,510
- Think you made a mistake, hiring me?
- I don't make mistakes, BoJack.

375
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:24,014
I do the crossword in Sharpie,
I never learned the shortcut for undo.

376
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:26,224
- Command-Z.
- Don't need it, won't use it.

377
00:19:26,307 --> 00:19:30,353
I'm trying to have this new attitude,
be this better, more positive guy.

378
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:33,731
I keep thinking about how this movie
is my last shot at happiness.

379
00:19:33,815 --> 00:19:35,692
Well, BoJack, I hope this helps:

380
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:39,237
I don't care if you are happy or not.

381
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,446
You have a job to do.

382
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:46,369
This guy again? I'm in love with this kid.
I wanna put you in my pocket.

383
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:49,039
- You're adorable.
- Aw.

384
00:19:51,249 --> 00:19:53,584
- Hey, Diane, you're a writer, aren't you?
- Yes.

385
00:19:53,668 --> 00:19:56,713
Yes. I am a writer. What do you need?

386
00:19:56,838 --> 00:19:59,049
Can you write on a sign
"watch out for cable"?

387
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:01,968
You were telling people,
but it's a really important job

388
00:20:02,052 --> 00:20:04,054
and a sign is less likely
to get distracted.

389
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:07,224
Oh. Yeah. Okay.

390
00:20:07,765 --> 00:20:08,933
What are you doing here?

391
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:10,476
What are you doing here?

392
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,562
What are you doing here?

393
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:15,439
- What are you doing here?
- So, I went a little overboard

394
00:20:15,523 --> 00:20:17,316
and I made you two mixes.

395
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,152
The first CD is all Mighty Mighty.

396
00:20:19,236 --> 00:20:22,780
The second CD is all of the Bosstones'
side projects and solo singles.

397
00:20:22,864 --> 00:20:25,742
Listen to it and imagine the band
never took that hiatus

398
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:28,828
in the mid-aughts
when America briefly lost interest in ska.

399
00:20:28,912 --> 00:20:31,664
I don't have time.
I don't wanna listen to your music.

400
00:20:31,748 --> 00:20:33,791
I don't wanna hang out.
Get out of here.

401
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:37,628
All right. You don't wanna listen
to Bosstones together.

402
00:20:37,754 --> 00:20:39,589
That's the impression that I get.

403
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:43,467
- Is it the impression that I get?
- Yes. That's the impression that you get.

404
00:20:44,761 --> 00:20:49,015
I see. Way to go, Mr. Peanutbutter.
What a stupid move. Why did you--?

405
00:20:52,602 --> 00:20:57,190
BoJack, listen, I know you're scared,
but it's gonna be okay.

406
00:20:57,274 --> 00:20:59,400
- You gotta be strong.
- Yeah, but--

407
00:20:59,483 --> 00:21:03,696
You gotta rise to the occasion, okay?
So what if the new couch is weird?

408
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,115
- Or lumpy?
- Uh, what?

409
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:08,409
What are you gonna do?
Just sleep in BoJack's car forever?

410
00:21:08,492 --> 00:21:12,830
- Are you talking to me, or you--?
- Damn it, time to stop being a coward.

411
00:21:12,914 --> 00:21:18,586
It's time to go home
and sleep on BoJack's couch. Hurray!

412
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:20,713
Happy ending for Todd!

413
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,559
Charley Witherspoon, 28th floor agent.

414
00:21:33,643 --> 00:21:37,605
Charley. Listen, I wanted to touch base
about Emily's start date on Jackie O.

415
00:21:37,688 --> 00:21:39,482
Oh, yeah. Uh...

416
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:42,485
Well, we got some new screen tests

417
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:46,364
and, uh, Goose decided to go
in a different direction.

418
00:21:46,447 --> 00:21:49,575
Are you saying the Van Sant camp
wants to recant on VanCamp?

419
00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:51,119
Because they can't.

420
00:21:51,202 --> 00:21:52,245
Uh...

421
00:21:52,329 --> 00:21:54,956
Charley, you better get your client
to change his mind

422
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,626
- or I'll walk up to the 28th floor and--
- Just kidding.

423
00:21:58,709 --> 00:22:01,545
- I can't get to the phone right now.
- What?

424
00:22:01,671 --> 00:22:06,425
This is one of those answering machines
that sounds like it's Charley talking

425
00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:09,012
but it's actually
just an answering machine.

426
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:11,389
- I know you're there, Charley.
- Leave a message.

427
00:22:11,472 --> 00:22:13,432
- I'm not gonna leave a message.
- Beep.

428
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:15,852
Hey, Charley, Princess Carolyn again.
Listen--

429
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:18,646
- Mailbox is full.
- What? Mailbox full?

430
00:22:18,729 --> 00:22:20,815
- Error. Message deleted.
- Wait-- No--

431
00:22:20,898 --> 00:22:22,025
Gotta go. Bye.

432
00:22:26,196 --> 00:22:28,323
Carolyn.

433
00:22:28,406 --> 00:22:30,283
Rutabaga, this is not a good time.

434
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:33,577
Okay. Can I please just tell you
about the opera, though?

435
00:22:34,745 --> 00:22:37,581
- How did you like the opera?
- I loved it.

436
00:22:37,665 --> 00:22:40,251
Loved Tristan, loved Isolde,
cried like a bunny.

437
00:22:40,335 --> 00:22:42,420
Listen, my brain has been a-buzzing

438
00:22:42,545 --> 00:22:45,423
for the past few days
thinking about that Jackie O movie.

439
00:22:45,506 --> 00:22:48,051
I know it's your baby,
but I did make a few calls

440
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:50,553
and got my Rooney a screen test.

441
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:52,847
I put that movie together for my client.

442
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,599
No, no, no, don't freak out.
It's just a screen test.

443
00:22:55,683 --> 00:22:58,144
But, honestly,
how fantaj would my Rooney be

444
00:22:58,228 --> 00:22:59,687
as a young Jackie Bouv?

445
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:04,442
Stomp once for so fantaj,
twice for stupid-fantaj.

446
00:23:04,525 --> 00:23:07,570
Carolyn? I only heard one stomp.

447
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:10,656
Oh. Carolyn, I heart you.
You're beautiful.

448
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,575
I wish I met you before I got married.

449
00:23:13,951 --> 00:23:15,745
You can do it.

450
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:18,331
Only you hold the keys
to the house that is you.

451
00:23:18,873 --> 00:23:21,292
The house is at the top of a hill.

452
00:23:21,376 --> 00:23:23,627
The hill is also you.

453
00:23:24,754 --> 00:23:26,005
Five minutes, Mr. Horseman.

454
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:28,425
When you get your new attitude,

455
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:31,510
you're gonna wave goodbye to the old--

456
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:36,974
What do you want, Mom?

457
00:23:37,058 --> 00:23:39,769
Look who finally decided
to pick up the phone.

458
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:42,230
- Do you need more blood?
- I don't need blood.

459
00:23:42,313 --> 00:23:45,066
- I read your book, BoJack.
- Oh.

460
00:23:45,149 --> 00:23:48,652
It takes a real narcissist to think
anyone wants to buy a book about him.

461
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,905
You know how I feel about Anne Frank.

462
00:23:50,988 --> 00:23:53,491
- That was a diary.
- I read the parts about me.

463
00:23:53,574 --> 00:23:56,619
The things I said to you.

464
00:23:56,953 --> 00:23:58,913
You must think I'm a real monster.

465
00:23:59,247 --> 00:24:01,665
- Mom--
- I don't wanna fight you, BoJack.

466
00:24:01,749 --> 00:24:04,752
I just wanted to tell you I know.

467
00:24:04,835 --> 00:24:07,880
I know you wanna be happy,
but you won't be, and--

468
00:24:09,132 --> 00:24:11,175
- I'm sorry.
- What?

469
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:13,761
It's not just you, you know.

470
00:24:13,844 --> 00:24:15,472
Your father and I, we--

471
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:21,060
Well, you come by it honestly,
the ugliness inside you.

472
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:24,939
You were born broken,
that's your birthright.

473
00:24:25,022 --> 00:24:28,109
And now you can fill your life
with projects

474
00:24:28,192 --> 00:24:31,529
your books and your movies
and your little girlfriends

475
00:24:31,612 --> 00:24:34,407
but it won't make you whole.

476
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:36,909
You're BoJack Horseman.

477
00:24:36,993 --> 00:24:39,412
There's no cure for that.

478
00:24:40,288 --> 00:24:44,208
Anyway, do you remember
who directed The Philadelphia Story?

479
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:46,085
Five letters, second letter U?

480
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:52,008
- Lubitsch?
- No, BoJack. Goodbye.

481
00:24:53,301 --> 00:24:55,261
You need to visualize it

482
00:24:55,345 --> 00:24:57,555
flying out the window, over the--

483
00:25:05,896 --> 00:25:07,731
What are you doing here?

484
00:25:07,815 --> 00:25:10,651
Great. We got it. Let's move on.

485
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:58,157
Boxer versus Raptor.
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.
