1
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:14,873
Whoa.

2
00:00:14,957 --> 00:00:17,584
So, that was weird.

3
00:00:17,668 --> 00:00:20,129
Yeah. Wait.
Why did you think that was weird?

4
00:00:20,212 --> 00:00:22,464
You know, you and me together, weird.

5
00:00:22,548 --> 00:00:25,259
So it's not because
I did that talking penis thing, right?

6
00:00:25,342 --> 00:00:28,262
Just the general concept of us
sleeping together that's weird, right?

7
00:00:28,345 --> 00:00:29,263
Yeah.

8
00:00:29,346 --> 00:00:35,144
Good morning, Hollywood.
It's a beautiful morning in sunny 2007.

9
00:00:35,227 --> 00:00:38,605
Oh, my God, 2007?
Is that what time it is?

10
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:41,024
I gotta get my Uggs on and get to work.

11
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:44,278
Well, you sure you don't want
to just hang around for a little bit?

12
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:47,906
- I got no plans.
- No, sadly, I have to go to my job,

13
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,492
to help my boss find gigs
for you to turn down.

14
00:00:50,576 --> 00:00:52,870
If Marv brought me something good,
I would do it.

15
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:55,497
Besides, I'm still decompressing
from my last gig.

16
00:00:55,581 --> 00:00:58,167
Horsin' Around?
That ended 11 years ago.

17
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,003
Really? Where does the time go?

18
00:01:01,086 --> 00:01:04,131
What, you're just gonna stay at home
and get drunk all day?

19
00:01:04,214 --> 00:01:08,177
Don't climb up my ass. I invited you
to play hooky and hang out with me.

20
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,929
I got a new HD DVD player.

21
00:01:11,013 --> 00:01:12,431
Let's get wrecked and get Shreked.

22
00:01:12,514 --> 00:01:15,726
BoJack, last night was fun
and you're sweet, sort of.

23
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:19,354
- I don't want to make a thing of this.
- We agree. It's not a thing.

24
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:21,023
- Not a thing.
- Definitely not a thing.

25
00:01:21,106 --> 00:01:24,193
No, this is not a thing.

26
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:26,028
Yeah.

27
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:19,996
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

28
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,809
Hey, Todd, I think you just got a text.

29
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,562
"Who do you like,
question mark, colon, bracket"?

30
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:43,855
That's a smiley face, homeslice.

31
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:45,899
- Who do you like?
- I don't like anyone.

32
00:02:45,983 --> 00:02:49,069
That's ridonkulous.
You have to like someone.

33
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:52,864
If I have to, I guess, uh... Kimber?

34
00:02:52,948 --> 00:02:56,076
Everyone likes Kimber.
That's like saying you like Fergie.

35
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:58,662
- Who do you like?
- I'm not allowed to like anyone.

36
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:02,874
My dad is real strict.
Do you know The Sopranos?

37
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:05,961
The show, or that weird saxophone
that Kenny G plays?

38
00:03:06,044 --> 00:03:09,965
The show, about the guy in the mob?
That's what my dad does.

39
00:03:10,048 --> 00:03:12,134
Whoa! Hey, speaking of mobs,

40
00:03:12,217 --> 00:03:15,345
we gotta bounce if we're gonna make
that flash mob at the Grove.

41
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,014
Man, I love flash mobs.

42
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,473
And I love you--

43
00:03:18,557 --> 00:03:21,727
Ubisoft's "Assassin's Creed".
It's a new video game.

44
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,521
- Okay, let's go flash mob.
- Whoo! Flash mobs.

45
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,527
I just don't know
how I feel about my husband

46
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,113
doing a bunch of wacky commercials
overseas.

47
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:35,574
Not overseas, underseas.

48
00:03:35,657 --> 00:03:38,785
You're looking at the new face
of Seaborn's Seahorse Milk.

49
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:40,662
What the hell is seahorse milk?

50
00:03:40,746 --> 00:03:43,832
Beats me, but you better believe
I'm trusting Seaborn's.

51
00:03:43,915 --> 00:03:45,959
For all my seahorse milk needs.

52
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:49,504
- It just seems a little cheesy.
- Hey, I'm not too big for anything.

53
00:03:49,588 --> 00:03:52,257
And my flip phone
is blowing up with opportunities.

54
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:54,718
Michael Vick made me
a very strange offer.

55
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,429
But I'm gonna hear him out.
Always take the meeting.

56
00:03:57,512 --> 00:03:58,930
Ahem. Can I help you?

57
00:03:59,014 --> 00:04:02,100
I'll have an Americano
with steamed milk instead of water.

58
00:04:02,184 --> 00:04:03,644
One latte?

59
00:04:03,727 --> 00:04:05,687
For you, my second and final wife?

60
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:08,398
Oh, I usually like a cool drink
when it's hot outside

61
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:10,400
and a warm drink when it's cold outside.

62
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:13,779
But today is a perfect day, so--

63
00:04:13,862 --> 00:04:16,365
One lukewarm coffee
for my gorgeous spouse.

64
00:04:16,448 --> 00:04:17,282
Name?

65
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:20,035
Jessica, obviously. I'm Jessica Biel?

66
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:23,538
- Mmm... uh...
- From Stealth? Summer Catch?

67
00:04:23,622 --> 00:04:25,582
Rules Of Attraction? Nothing?

68
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:29,294
Girl from Seventh Heaven who
took her clothes off for that magazine?

69
00:04:29,378 --> 00:04:32,339
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you, Blarn?

70
00:04:32,422 --> 00:04:33,965
That's my name.

71
00:04:36,718 --> 00:04:38,929
So she kissed a girl, huh?

72
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,265
And she liked it? This I gotta see.

73
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:43,642
Talk to you later.

74
00:04:43,725 --> 00:04:46,311
P.C., where are you hiding?

75
00:04:46,395 --> 00:04:49,731
Right out here, Marv, same place
I've been for the last 14 years.

76
00:04:49,815 --> 00:04:52,984
Get in here and tell me
what scripts I read this weekend.

77
00:04:53,068 --> 00:04:54,903
We have three standouts here.

78
00:04:54,986 --> 00:04:57,364
A feature called
No Country For Old Men.

79
00:04:57,447 --> 00:04:59,658
It's about a hunter who--

80
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:04,079
Sorry, I fell asleep for a second.
Because that title's too long.

81
00:05:04,162 --> 00:05:07,082
No Country For Old Men
It's About A Hunter Who?

82
00:05:07,165 --> 00:05:08,291
Pass.

83
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,503
- Aaah!
- Titles should be two words.

84
00:05:11,586 --> 00:05:13,922
Pretty Woman. Beautiful Girls.

85
00:05:14,005 --> 00:05:15,132
Private Parts.

86
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:18,218
Then you might not like this next one,
There Will Be Blood?

87
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:20,095
There will not be blood.

88
00:05:20,178 --> 00:05:23,432
I would have accepted
There Will, or Be Blood.

89
00:05:23,515 --> 00:05:25,892
- Firm pass.
- Oh!

90
00:05:25,976 --> 00:05:27,811
This last one is really special.

91
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:32,774
It's a TV pilot from a veteran sitcom
writer named Cuddlywhiskers called...

92
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,903
- Hmm... Mitch's Life.
- Now there's a title.

93
00:05:36,987 --> 00:05:40,240
I think if we attach the right talent,
this could be a hit.

94
00:05:40,323 --> 00:05:42,325
You know who'd be great?
BoJack Horseman.

95
00:05:43,535 --> 00:05:47,205
Don't make me laugh, because I have
a heart condition and it could kill me.

96
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:50,750
Every little thing I bring that guy,
he turns down.

97
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:52,752
I think with the right project,
BoJack could--

98
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:57,382
Bup, bup, bup! P.C., do I get you coffee
and pick up your dry cleaning

99
00:05:57,466 --> 00:06:00,343
and buy you peek-a-boo negligees
for strange women

100
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:03,513
- you saw at the train station once?
- No.

101
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:07,392
Then how about I don't do your job
and you don't do my job?

102
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:10,395
You know,
I would like to be an agent someday.

103
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,647
Yeah, yeah, someday, sure.

104
00:06:12,731 --> 00:06:15,192
But for now,
you're learning from one of the greats.

105
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:16,943
Mark my words.

106
00:06:17,027 --> 00:06:22,073
The best agent in the world
couldn't get that joker off his ass.

107
00:06:22,157 --> 00:06:23,283
Hmm...

108
00:06:25,494 --> 00:06:27,996
BoJack, I brought you Four Loko.

109
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,000
I brought four Four Lokos.
That's 16 Lokos.

110
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,544
Finally someone brings me
an adequate amount of Lokos.

111
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,421
Are you trying to get me drunk?

112
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:39,257
You were trying to get me drunk.

113
00:06:39,341 --> 00:06:41,218
Where are you taking me,
what am I wearing?

114
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:42,761
To a meeting, and your clothes.

115
00:06:42,844 --> 00:06:45,805
Is this a fedora?
What am I, Jason Mirzizzerzaz?

116
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:47,265
- I don't know.
- You know who.

117
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:50,227
I knew you wouldn't take this meeting
if I didn't trick you into it.

118
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,021
Cuddlywhiskers has a great script
and wants to meet you.

119
00:06:53,104 --> 00:06:56,149
I have a script for you. It's called
"The BoJack Says No Chronicles".

120
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:57,609
Fade in, Princess Carolyn's car.

121
00:06:57,692 --> 00:07:02,322
Princess Carolyn: "Hey, BoJack, you want
to do this dumbass thing?" Act break.

122
00:07:02,405 --> 00:07:04,824
Act two.
BoJack turns to Princess Carolyn.

123
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:07,911
BoJack: "No, thank you." End of episode.

124
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,664
Hey! Aren't you the horse
from Horsin' Around?

125
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:14,334
You see, this is why I don't
go out amongst the not-famouses.

126
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:16,503
Just do me a favor
and take this meeting.

127
00:07:16,586 --> 00:07:18,213
If you're a good boy,

128
00:07:18,296 --> 00:07:21,842
we can do that weird French thing
you saw in that Internet video.

129
00:07:21,925 --> 00:07:23,134
Ooh, parkour?

130
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:28,223
This show came to me
when I was in rehab.

131
00:07:28,306 --> 00:07:31,852
I realized I'm only here on this earth
for a bit, why not dig deeper?

132
00:07:31,935 --> 00:07:33,478
- Huh.
- Don't get me wrong.

133
00:07:33,562 --> 00:07:36,606
I'm proud of the seven years
I spent on Krill & Grace.

134
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,776
That show did so much
for the way society views krill people.

135
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,319
That show didn't make me happy.

136
00:07:41,403 --> 00:07:43,738
The awards, the money
didn't make me happy.

137
00:07:43,822 --> 00:07:45,824
Did you try spending the money on things?

138
00:07:45,907 --> 00:07:49,619
I started to feel like I was trapped
in a giant plastic ball.

139
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:52,831
BoJack, meet my lovely assistant,
Jill Filipowicz.

140
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:53,748
- Hey.
- Hi.

141
00:07:53,832 --> 00:07:57,127
- Did I say you could speak, wench?
- You can't talk to me like that.

142
00:07:58,587 --> 00:08:01,840
- Clean up that mess this instant!
- No. I'm a dirty girl.

143
00:08:02,632 --> 00:08:04,593
- Uh...
- I'm filthy.

144
00:08:04,676 --> 00:08:07,929
- You are being very bad.
- You'll have to punish me later.

145
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:12,809
Jill and I have a very...
special relationship.

146
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:15,353
Want to tell me about the show?
I hear it's great.

147
00:08:15,437 --> 00:08:17,606
I've worked on great shows
my whole career.

148
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:18,982
Great shows are easy.

149
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:22,819
I didn't become president of the Lampoon
so I could make "great" shows.

150
00:08:23,778 --> 00:08:25,322
- Harvard Lampoon.
- Yeah, I got it.

151
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:27,449
I'm trying to do something different here.

152
00:08:27,532 --> 00:08:29,659
- Something that lasts.
- Huh.

153
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:30,577
Think about it.

154
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,289
If you're ready to finally stop being
"The Horse" from Horsin' Around,

155
00:08:34,372 --> 00:08:37,918
send me an e-mail:
Cuddlywhiskers@harvard.edu.

156
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:39,711
- That's H-A-R--
- I got it.

157
00:08:43,882 --> 00:08:45,091
You got some mail, babe.

158
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:48,887
Mwah! You understand I'm using
that pet name ironically, right?

159
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:49,971
Yes, Wayne.

160
00:08:50,055 --> 00:08:54,434
Oh, my God, check it out,
a rejection letter from The New Yorker.

161
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:59,189
That magazine is for white people.
White people are the worst, right, guys?

162
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:00,565
Yup.

163
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:03,234
"Dear Diane.
We are sorry to say that your piece,

164
00:09:03,318 --> 00:09:05,904
'An Open Letter to Open Letters',
wasn't right for us,

165
00:09:05,987 --> 00:09:09,407
despite its evident merit."
Do you know what this means?

166
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:12,827
Caring leads to disappointment?
Trying is stupid and so is having dreams?

167
00:09:12,911 --> 00:09:15,830
Someone gave my piece a read
and decided against it.

168
00:09:15,914 --> 00:09:19,167
Their journalistic style
couldn't be more outmoded.

169
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,129
- Satire? More like "sa-tired."
- I never even thought they'd read it.

170
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:27,425
"Talk of the Town"?
More like "Schlock of the Clown".

171
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:31,012
Then they typed me a letter
that said it had "obvious merit".

172
00:09:31,096 --> 00:09:33,974
"Shouts and Murmurs"?
More like "Louts and..."

173
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:35,517
What rhymes with murmurs?

174
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,602
For two people
who don't like The New Yorker,

175
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:40,563
you know a lot about the different
sections of The New Yorker.

176
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:43,274
And then Cuddlywhiskers said:

177
00:09:43,358 --> 00:09:46,403
"What if we stopped thinking of TV
as a conduit to tell stories

178
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,780
and thinking of it
as a conduit to tell truth?"

179
00:09:48,863 --> 00:09:52,200
And I was like: "Damn, this guy
must have gone to Yale or something."

180
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:54,160
Sounds like you two really hit it off.

181
00:09:54,244 --> 00:09:56,413
We were like Heidi and Spencer
up in there.

182
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:58,123
So you're gonna do the show?

183
00:09:58,206 --> 00:10:00,083
Nah. Timing's really off right now.

184
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,086
iPhone's coming out this year,
I need to gear up for that.

185
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:06,464
I'm done. That's it, I'm tired
of bending over backwards for you.

186
00:10:06,548 --> 00:10:08,842
I mean this in all seriousness,
professionally or in bed?

187
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:11,636
Why won't you do this?
Give me one good reason.

188
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,267
Because his show sounds incredible.
And what if... I'm not?

189
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,687
What if there's a reason the only thing
I'm known for is Horsin' Around?

190
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,732
BoJack, you are amazing.

191
00:10:23,815 --> 00:10:27,318
You're bright and you're funny
and you're handsome and you're talented.

192
00:10:27,402 --> 00:10:29,404
But if you can't see that,

193
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:32,615
then you're the biggest,
dumbest piece of shit in the world.

194
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:42,292
How long do we have to stay in here?

195
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,627
- It's called Seven Minutes in Heaven.
- Uh...

196
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,337
We don't have to kiss.

197
00:10:46,421 --> 00:10:48,631
I know you'd rather be in here
with Kimber.

198
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:51,509
That's not true. It's just that, Emily...

199
00:10:51,593 --> 00:10:54,304
- What?
- I've never kissed anyone before.

200
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,848
That's okay.
Maybe we can try with each other?

201
00:10:56,931 --> 00:11:00,602
That way, when you're in here with Kimber
one day, you'll know exactly what to do.

202
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:06,024
Okay, so how should we do it?
French style, Eskimo, Butterfly?

203
00:11:06,107 --> 00:11:09,527
I'll tell you. I know exactly what to do
because I practice all the time

204
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:11,654
with a picture of Adam Brody--
No, I don't!

205
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:16,618
Just close your eyes,
and we move our faces toward each other.

206
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:20,580
- Okay.
- Until we...

207
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:27,253
Oh!

208
00:11:27,337 --> 00:11:31,049
Well, the elusive BoJack Horseman.

209
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:36,763
You do, huh? Hey, Princess Carolyn,
guess who just got BoJack a job.

210
00:11:36,846 --> 00:11:41,518
You... are the secretary
of a wonderful agent.

211
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:45,230
Now go pick up
a pair of satin crotchless undies.

212
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:48,107
I saw a stewardess
at the Yum Yum Donuts.

213
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:50,568
We did not make eye contact.

214
00:11:51,736 --> 00:11:53,446
Good morning, Los Angeles.

215
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,783
It's two months later in 2007.

216
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:59,327
Two months later?
Two months later than what?

217
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,703
Did I say two months later?

218
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:04,040
Cookie chartreuse brontosaurus,
I think I'm having a stroke.

219
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,166
Aaah!

220
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,794
- Jeez, sleep much?
- Jeez, watch me sleep much?

221
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:09,212
Well, I couldn't sleep.

222
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,214
I kept thinking about
today's first read-through.

223
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,966
These things
are always so nerve-wracking,

224
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:16,219
to sit there and perform
for all these people like some kind of a--

225
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,638
- Professional actor?
- Very funny.

226
00:12:18,721 --> 00:12:21,474
Before I forget, I got you a present.

227
00:12:21,558 --> 00:12:25,979
It's a box...
with crinkly tissue paper inside it.

228
00:12:26,062 --> 00:12:27,355
How did you know?

229
00:12:27,438 --> 00:12:29,274
Thank you
for putting this whole thing together.

230
00:12:29,357 --> 00:12:32,694
Even though I still can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

231
00:12:32,777 --> 00:12:34,612
Promise me
everything's going to be okay?

232
00:12:34,696 --> 00:12:36,823
I promise it's gonna be great.

233
00:12:36,906 --> 00:12:39,284
If you get scared,
look for me in the audience.

234
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:43,121
I'll be there the whole time,
laughing and cheering louder than anyone.

235
00:12:43,204 --> 00:12:45,623
- Mmm...
- Mm-mmm-mm.

236
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,879
"Mitch tosses the vodka bottle
into the garbage. Thud."

237
00:12:50,962 --> 00:12:52,422
"Goodbye, old friend."

238
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,842
"Mitch turns off the light
and closes the door as we...

239
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:58,428
Fade to black. End of episode."

240
00:13:01,764 --> 00:13:03,474
Thank you.

241
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,520
Let's see what the suits say.

242
00:13:07,604 --> 00:13:10,523
Bet they're gonna want to bland it up,
make it appeal to middle America.

243
00:13:10,607 --> 00:13:12,775
That's the worst part of America.

244
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:15,361
Other than the bottom,
the top and most of the sides.

245
00:13:15,445 --> 00:13:18,656
BoJack, Cuddlywhiskers,
what can we say?

246
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,910
This is why you guys are the pros
and we're just the schmoes.

247
00:13:21,993 --> 00:13:25,830
I think what my husband
is trying to say is, "Great job."

248
00:13:25,914 --> 00:13:27,290
Enough with the torture.

249
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,751
Don't have to feed me to finger me.
Just lay on the notes.

250
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:32,462
Our only note? No notes.

251
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,923
- No notes?
- We love this show.

252
00:13:35,006 --> 00:13:36,883
BoJack, I'm calling it right now.

253
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:40,219
This show is gonna be as big
as Horsin' Around.

254
00:13:41,763 --> 00:13:43,222
Huh.

255
00:13:43,306 --> 00:13:49,145
And then Justin said, "Jessica Biel?
You are un-Jessica-Bielievable."

256
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,022
- It was so funny.
- Wow.

257
00:13:51,105 --> 00:13:54,275
It seems like you're really
in sync with this Justin guy.

258
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:57,111
You should do all the things
with him that I can't do.

259
00:13:57,195 --> 00:14:01,324
Like eat chocolate,
or enjoy fireworks, or watch tennis.

260
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:05,161
Why, tennis makes me so mad.
Why doesn't anyone ever catch the ball?

261
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:08,164
Hello? Can we please get
some service in this place?

262
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:12,585
I'm famous actress Jessica Biel.
I'm one of the Jessicas.

263
00:14:12,669 --> 00:14:15,254
Mom, I'm finally gonna be
a published writer.

264
00:14:15,338 --> 00:14:18,675
My "Open Letter to Open Letters"
is going to be published in McSweeney's.

265
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,885
Mc-What? Who's that? Some Irish?

266
00:14:20,969 --> 00:14:24,013
No, Mom. It's a very popular website.

267
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:26,724
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm not falling for that scam.

268
00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:30,186
Website? We gotta print it out
on our own paper with our own ink?

269
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,604
- I don't think so.
- Mom.

270
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:35,149
And my Blockbuster original series
has been keeping me very busy.

271
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:37,652
I still don't get how that's gonna work,
at all.

272
00:14:37,735 --> 00:14:39,487
Babe, it makes total sense.

273
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,031
They make the whole season,
put it on six DVD's.

274
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,117
People go to their local Blockbuster Video

275
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,953
and rent it out one disc at a time
for five days each.

276
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:49,080
What if someone already rented
the episodes they want?

277
00:14:49,163 --> 00:14:53,001
They can just get something else,
like The Illusionist or The Prestige.

278
00:14:53,084 --> 00:14:55,795
- Whichever one you were in.
- Do you know which one?

279
00:14:55,878 --> 00:14:58,298
Do you?

280
00:14:58,381 --> 00:15:03,011
- Why do you say yes to everything?
- I get excited by the possibilities.

281
00:15:03,094 --> 00:15:06,180
Look, a CD, at a coffee shop?
That is crazy.

282
00:15:06,264 --> 00:15:08,141
- Buying it.
- Eh-eh eh-eh! No.

283
00:15:08,224 --> 00:15:10,101
Drop it. Drop it.

284
00:15:10,184 --> 00:15:11,394
Good boy.

285
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:16,566
Buzz-buzz-buzz buzz buzz-buzz!

286
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,152
- You heard what the network said.
- Heard they loved it.

287
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:20,820
Yoo-hoo! I also heard that.

288
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:22,947
Exactly. The network loved it.

289
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:24,824
Obviously, we're playing it too safe.

290
00:15:24,907 --> 00:15:28,244
If you want my opinion, fellas,
you hit oil, stop drilling.

291
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:32,248
"I am an oil man.
I drink your milkshake."

292
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:35,710
- That'll be funny in a year or so.
- Before that got sad and weird,

293
00:15:35,793 --> 00:15:38,171
you said, "If you want my opinion,"
and we don't.

294
00:15:38,254 --> 00:15:41,007
Cuddlywhiskers, you told me
you wanted to do something different.

295
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:44,635
Now we're doing something that's gonna be
"just as good as Horsin' Around."

296
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:46,971
Is that what you wanted?
That's not why I'm here.

297
00:15:47,055 --> 00:15:49,682
- I know.
- I really think you're making a mistake.

298
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:51,184
I'm not taking career advice

299
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:53,686
from somebody who's been
an assistant the last 14 years.

300
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,481
Is that how you think of me?
As your agent's assistant?

301
00:15:56,564 --> 00:15:59,025
- What do you think you are?
- I don't know.

302
00:15:59,108 --> 00:16:01,110
Here's some free advice:
you should know.

303
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:03,071
Why don't you leave this to the grown-ups?

304
00:16:03,154 --> 00:16:05,031
Somebody needs coffee,
I'll give you a ring.

305
00:16:05,114 --> 00:16:06,908
Okay, best of luck.

306
00:16:08,242 --> 00:16:10,953
Cuddlywhiskers,
let's give ourselves one night

307
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:15,625
to stick our dicks in this script
and go balls deep into the universe.

308
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,918
I'm in.

309
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,799
What's that, you say?
There's a panic? At the disco?

310
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,801
I gotta go. What do you want, Toots?

311
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:27,470
I want to be an agent. I think I'm ready.

312
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:30,473
Again with this
"I wanna be a female agent" thing.

313
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:34,894
They don't even have a word for it.
Uh, agentess, agentrix.

314
00:16:34,977 --> 00:16:38,231
- It's just called "agent", Marv, agent.
- Okay, okay!

315
00:16:38,314 --> 00:16:42,151
You're an agent, all right?
I dub thee agent.

316
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:44,946
You can even take my office,
because I quit.

317
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:46,781
- What?
- Who needs the headache?

318
00:16:46,864 --> 00:16:53,121
Thirty years I threw into this job
and it destroyed me from the inside out.

319
00:16:53,204 --> 00:16:56,916
I never fell in love,
I never had a family.

320
00:16:56,999 --> 00:17:00,169
I never even got to give that lacy teddy

321
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:03,381
to the mean woman who worked at the DMV.

322
00:17:03,464 --> 00:17:07,635
All I have is regrets.

323
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:13,182
Oh, my God, I'm an agent!
I'm gonna make it after all.

324
00:17:15,017 --> 00:17:16,936
Whaah!

325
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:19,981
First thing I'm gonna do
is get rid of that ceiling fan.

326
00:17:21,899 --> 00:17:25,403
How do we make it clear
that this isn't Horsin' Around?

327
00:17:25,486 --> 00:17:28,489
What if in the very first scene,
we show my character

328
00:17:28,573 --> 00:17:33,744
literally taking a massive dump
on a VHS copy of Horsin' Around?

329
00:17:33,828 --> 00:17:35,079
What? That's insane.

330
00:17:35,163 --> 00:17:38,040
Let's just put it in,
we can always take it out later.

331
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,543
I want this character to be really edgy,

332
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:43,337
the kind of character Denis Leary
would be offered and then say:

333
00:17:43,421 --> 00:17:45,089
"This character's too edgy for me."

334
00:17:45,173 --> 00:17:47,633
What if he had a catchphrase
that was an anti-catchphrase?

335
00:17:47,717 --> 00:17:51,554
Like if every time he entered the room
he was like, "Whassup, bitches?"

336
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,891
Not that, because that's horrible.
But something like that.

337
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:55,850
Whassup, bitches?

338
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:58,102
- That is so dumb.
- But kind of brilliant, right?

339
00:17:58,186 --> 00:18:01,481
Yes, put that in.
Put all this in, this should be the show.

340
00:18:01,564 --> 00:18:04,192
This should be the show.

341
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:07,111
I haven't felt this alive
since the head of the Charles Regatta.

342
00:18:07,195 --> 00:18:09,739
- That's a Harvard thing.
- Yes. This is brilliant.

343
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,825
What if we had five minutes of him
reading a book to himself?

344
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:14,202
Oh, my God, yes.

345
00:18:14,285 --> 00:18:17,371
Just him turning the page.
A close-up of my eyeball.

346
00:18:17,455 --> 00:18:20,458
The real shit, they never show that.

347
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,752
Wow, we did it.

348
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:27,006
We stayed up all night, but we really made
something new and different and daring.

349
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:28,674
We've changed everything but the title.

350
00:18:28,758 --> 00:18:31,219
Well, then, how about
we give it a new title?

351
00:18:31,302 --> 00:18:33,429
The BoJack Horseman Show.

352
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:35,848
Oh, Cuddlywhiskers,
I don't know what to say.

353
00:18:35,932 --> 00:18:39,268
Well, then why don't you just say,
"Whassup, bitches?"

354
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:41,103
But, you know, not that.

355
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:43,481
- Something like that.
- We'll figure it out.

356
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:50,780
Seriously, can I hear 400 dollars?
Let's not forget why we're here tonight.

357
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,032
To raise money
for the John Edwards campaign.

358
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:55,326
I was talking
to one of the volunteers earlier

359
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:58,496
and she was just gushing
about how John Edwards touched her.

360
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:02,625
I say, let's make this man president
so he can touch whoever he wants.

361
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,253
- Four hundred dollars.
- I don't know what's cheesier,

362
00:19:05,336 --> 00:19:07,797
this three-cheese risotto
or that dude's patter.

363
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,756
Seriously.

364
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:13,219
This fundraiser should have a fundraiser
for a better host of this fundraiser.

365
00:19:13,302 --> 00:19:14,178
Totes McGotes.

366
00:19:14,262 --> 00:19:16,889
I'll post that to my Twitter page.
You should follow me.

367
00:19:16,973 --> 00:19:20,601
I'm A with a circle around it,
"insWayne in the membWayne".

368
00:19:20,685 --> 00:19:22,186
What's a Twitter page?

369
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:26,649
Erica, you know you're not
allowed to vote in national elections.

370
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:33,990
You sure it's okay
to be in your parents' bedroom?

371
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:37,910
Todd, so we've been together
for months now.

372
00:19:37,994 --> 00:19:42,081
Um, I was thinking maybe that we try sex?

373
00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:42,999
Uh...

374
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,835
We don't have to.
I don't wanna peer pressure you.

375
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:50,089
No. I'm ready for sexual situations.

376
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:53,843
- Um...
- Hooray. Um, taking your virginity.

377
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,761
Yeah, sure. That's how I would say it.

378
00:19:55,845 --> 00:20:01,017
Okay, here we-- Here I go.
Uh, this is Todd doing sex.

379
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,477
Did you hear that?

380
00:20:03,561 --> 00:20:07,148
Oh, snap. My dad's home early.
You gotta get out of here.

381
00:20:07,231 --> 00:20:08,774
Your dad, the mobster?

382
00:20:08,858 --> 00:20:10,359
What? My dad's not a mobster.

383
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:12,778
You said he was like that guy
from The Sopranos.

384
00:20:12,862 --> 00:20:15,489
I said he works on The Sopranos.
He's an editor.

385
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:17,491
Oh, God, oh, God! Even worse.

386
00:20:17,575 --> 00:20:19,869
He must be so desensitized to violence

387
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,872
and nihilistic ruminations
on the banality of evil.

388
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,124
Here, out the window.
You love shimmying, right?

389
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:28,961
You know I love shimmying,
but that's a two-story drop.

390
00:20:29,045 --> 00:20:30,504
Use this.

391
00:20:32,173 --> 00:20:33,966
- Go, get out. Go, go!
- Uh, okay.

392
00:20:35,217 --> 00:20:36,677
Oh, shit.

393
00:20:37,261 --> 00:20:38,554
Sorry.

394
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:45,645
Whoa, whoa, Tony marries Dr. Melfi?

395
00:20:45,728 --> 00:20:47,980
Mamma mia!

396
00:20:52,526 --> 00:20:55,821
- So, the island's purgatory, right?
- What's really happening--

397
00:20:55,905 --> 00:20:57,239
Hold that thought.

398
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,867
Hey, Princess Carolyn, you came.

399
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,746
I figured since I'm your agent, I should
at least show up to your premiere party.

400
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,582
I know I haven't called in a while.
I've been really busy.

401
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,001
I figured you'd call me
if you needed a coffee.

402
00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:10,920
Ouch.

403
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,339
Hey, big premiere tonight.
Very exciting.

404
00:21:13,422 --> 00:21:14,256
Yeah.

405
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,468
After tonight, it's no more "Aren't you
the horse from Horsin' Around?"

406
00:21:17,551 --> 00:21:20,429
From now on it'll be,
"You're BoJack Horseman."

407
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:22,306
I'm happy for you, BoJack.

408
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,975
- How about a kiss for good luck?
- No, BoJack.

409
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:28,646
I'm your agent and your friend,
and I will always support you.

410
00:21:28,729 --> 00:21:32,900
But I'm 33 years old, and I want
to have a family by the time I'm 40.

411
00:21:32,983 --> 00:21:36,529
I don't want to spend the next seven years
in and out of love with you.

412
00:21:36,612 --> 00:21:39,490
I've wasted too much time
waiting for things to happen.

413
00:21:39,573 --> 00:21:41,242
And I'm not gonna wait anymore.

414
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,955
And for what it's worth, I always liked
the horse from Horsin' Around.

415
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:49,250
- You did?
- Yeah. Everybody did.

416
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:55,005
Unbelievable.
Un-Jessica-Bielievable.

417
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:57,174
Can we not fight while I'm at a gig?

418
00:21:57,258 --> 00:22:00,469
There are a lot of big producers,
this could be my next big break.

419
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,847
This podunk benefit is below us.

420
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:06,976
I'm about to be in what I've been told
is a very important gay rights movie,

421
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,769
I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry.

422
00:22:08,853 --> 00:22:12,857
I now pronounce me very impressed,
but I'm not getting those kinds of offers.

423
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,695
- As Justin would say, "Cry me a river."
- Hey, if you like Justin so much,

424
00:22:17,778 --> 00:22:20,489
maybe you should just continue
to be really good friends with him.

425
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:22,324
Fine, maybe I will marry Justin.

426
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:23,909
Uh, I didn't say that.

427
00:22:23,993 --> 00:22:27,746
I now pronounce this marriage over.
Biel with it.

428
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,502
- You wanted water?
- Thanks.

429
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:37,131
Wait. Blarn, right?
Yeah, from the coffee shop.

430
00:22:37,214 --> 00:22:40,301
What are you doing here?
Is there coffee to "bariste"?

431
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:43,262
I also do cater waiter gigs
to make ends meet.

432
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:47,433
You "bariste" and cater and waiter?
Triple threat.

433
00:22:47,516 --> 00:22:49,351
I should be bringing you the water.

434
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:53,981
You know, just for the record, I think
it's cool that you put yourself out there.

435
00:22:54,064 --> 00:22:56,525
A lot of guys in your position
wouldn't take gigs like this.

436
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:58,819
They'd be afraid people
would make fun of them.

437
00:22:58,903 --> 00:22:59,778
That's dumb.

438
00:22:59,862 --> 00:23:02,990
If you care about what other people think,
you're never gonna do anything.

439
00:23:03,073 --> 00:23:06,327
- Yeah, you're right.
- Oh, my God, I'm so glad you agree.

440
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:09,413
I was like, "Why did I say that?
That was so dumb."

441
00:23:09,497 --> 00:23:12,583
Then you were like, "That's right."
And I was like, "Ooh! Validation."

442
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:15,461
- Hey, mind if I change out of this shirt?
- Go ahead.

443
00:23:15,544 --> 00:23:17,713
This monkey suit is killing me.

444
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:20,174
Oof! Hey there, Delilah.

445
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:24,136
Sweet hang, Blarn.
You're one in a million.

446
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,514
- Actually, my name isn't Blarn.
- What?

447
00:23:26,597 --> 00:23:28,891
I put that on my nametag as a dumb joke

448
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,393
to subvert the idea
of co-opting personal identity

449
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:35,064
to further corporate branding which,
as I'm saying it, isn't much of a joke.

450
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:39,985
"Blarn." That is very funny.
You should be a writer.

451
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:41,987
Thanks. I'm Diane.

452
00:23:42,071 --> 00:23:43,822
- Mr. Peanutbutter.
- Yeah, I know.

453
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:45,533
- Add me on MySpace, okay?
- Sure.

454
00:23:45,616 --> 00:23:49,954
All right.
Guess I'll see you around, Diana.

455
00:23:50,621 --> 00:23:52,081
It's Diane.

456
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:56,126
Hey, buddy, slight change of plans.

457
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,212
Call it off.
Call the whole thing off.

458
00:23:58,295 --> 00:24:00,589
What do you mean?
We premiere in two minutes.

459
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:02,299
Call the network,
cancel the whole thing.

460
00:24:02,383 --> 00:24:04,760
Nobody wants to see me take a dump
on a Horsin' Around VHS.

461
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:08,639
BoJack, it's going to be fine.
This is what we wanted, remember?

462
00:24:08,722 --> 00:24:11,016
Easy for you to say.
It's my name on the show.

463
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,478
This is why I didn't want to do
another TV show. Everything was perfect.

464
00:24:14,562 --> 00:24:17,731
BoJack, this shit is bananas.
B-A-N-A-N-A-S.

465
00:24:17,815 --> 00:24:19,817
I can't promise everyone
will love this show.

466
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,652
No matter what, people will remember it.

467
00:24:21,735 --> 00:24:25,197
Five, ten years from now, this is the show
people will associate you with,

468
00:24:25,281 --> 00:24:27,032
and you'll be glad they do.

469
00:24:27,116 --> 00:24:29,994
Because this show is real,
it's edgy, it's different.

470
00:24:30,077 --> 00:24:32,454
A lesser talent
couldn't have pulled it off.

471
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:34,915
But I'm willing to bet
on BoJack Horseman.

472
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:37,543
- Are you?
- Yes, I am.

473
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:42,089
Great. Because the show is starting
and your life is about to change forever,

474
00:24:42,172 --> 00:24:44,717
in three, two, one.

475
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,677
Whassup, bitches?

476
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:47,385
