1
00:00:14,858 --> 00:00:16,817
Aw, she looks so peaceful.

2
00:00:16,818 --> 00:00:19,629
Think she's dreaming that
she's not overstaying her welcome?

3
00:00:19,696 --> 00:00:21,864
When she got that wine delivered
to the house,

4
00:00:21,865 --> 00:00:24,825
I thought that was her thank-you present,
that she was leaving,

5
00:00:24,826 --> 00:00:27,578
- but then she just drank the wine.
- Five days ago.

6
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:29,306
- Morning, everybody.
- Aah! Kinko!

7
00:00:29,372 --> 00:00:32,558
Another beautiful day
in the city of Brotherly Angels.

8
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:36,212
Todd, I don't recall
accidentally ingesting poison,

9
00:00:36,213 --> 00:00:38,398
and yet here you are
trying to make me vomit.

10
00:00:38,464 --> 00:00:41,109
You wanna go buy me a kite
and then fly a kite?

11
00:00:41,176 --> 00:00:42,986
No. Kites are sky trash.

12
00:00:43,053 --> 00:00:47,740
Why is it so daytime right now?

13
00:00:47,807 --> 00:00:48,724
Wanda?

14
00:00:49,976 --> 00:00:53,205
Wanna go surf some cloud waves?
That's what I call wind.

15
00:00:53,272 --> 00:00:55,231
Sorry. Some of us have jobs.

16
00:00:55,232 --> 00:00:57,441
Not all of us. Just some of us.

17
00:00:57,442 --> 00:00:59,627
Oh, yeah, my job.

18
00:01:01,487 --> 00:01:02,780
- Morning.
- What?

19
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:06,450
I'm done with my sabbatical
and I'm ready to get back to work.

20
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:08,202
What sabbatical? I fired you.

21
00:01:08,203 --> 00:01:10,621
Oh, I thought
when you said, "You're fired,"

22
00:01:10,622 --> 00:01:13,457
that was just you
"giving me the business."

23
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,894
No, I was taking the "business"
away from you.

24
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:17,478
Oh.

25
00:01:17,837 --> 00:01:20,380
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.
You wanna go fly a kite?

26
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:22,674
Put me down
for a supersized "sounds great."

27
00:01:22,675 --> 00:01:25,987
But with an even larger main course
of "sadly, I cannot."

28
00:01:26,054 --> 00:01:29,848
I am swamped here at work.
First, I gotta put my suit on.

29
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:31,576
Then I gotta go to hair and makeup.

30
00:01:31,643 --> 00:01:33,245
Then we record the show.

31
00:01:33,312 --> 00:01:35,538
And then I gotta take my suit off.

32
00:01:35,605 --> 00:01:38,607
So, that's, like, the whole day. Sorry.

33
00:01:43,322 --> 00:01:44,214
Ah.

34
00:01:44,323 --> 00:01:45,506
"Looking for a friend?"

35
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:46,799
Yes.

36
00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:48,218
"Need direction?"

37
00:01:48,285 --> 00:01:49,635
I'm listening.

38
00:01:49,702 --> 00:01:52,013
"Try Scientology"?

39
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,081
- Huh.
- Excuse me? Sir?

40
00:01:54,082 --> 00:01:55,415
- Huh?
- Have you ever thought

41
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,852
about trying improv comedy?

42
00:01:57,877 --> 00:02:01,606
Improv comedy? I don't know...

43
00:02:01,673 --> 00:02:04,091
Why not?
It's not like there's anything else to do.

44
00:02:04,092 --> 00:02:05,610
Here on Mars.

45
00:02:05,677 --> 00:02:07,028
We're on Mars?

46
00:02:07,095 --> 00:02:11,807
Yes. And in a Martian ice cream shop.
Care for a butterscotch swirl?

47
00:02:11,808 --> 00:02:12,909
Whoa!

48
00:02:12,976 --> 00:02:15,536
The only limit is my imagination.

49
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:18,397
Why not come by our theater
and try a free class?

50
00:02:18,398 --> 00:02:22,484
Okay!
Can I bring this food inside the theater?

51
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:24,236
Ha, good one.

52
00:02:24,237 --> 00:02:26,589
- But no.
- Oh.

53
00:03:23,463 --> 00:03:26,257
"That's when I learned
that guns can blow a vato away.

54
00:03:26,258 --> 00:03:30,510
But calculus?
Calculus can blow a mind away."

55
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:31,779
Cut!

56
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:32,947
We got it!

57
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:34,598
That's the day, everybody.

58
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:39,603
- You sure we got it, Abe?
- Of course. You were phenomenal.

59
00:03:39,604 --> 00:03:42,707
Really? Because that kid sneezed
in the middle of my monologue.

60
00:03:42,774 --> 00:03:45,484
- We can fix that in post.
- Abe, I'm supposed to tell you

61
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:47,319
the boom mike fell into the last shot.

62
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,114
You sure you don't wanna get another take?
Just for safety?

63
00:03:50,115 --> 00:03:53,092
What am I, Kubrick?
We can fix all this stuff in post.

64
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,119
It's an easy scene.

65
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,457
Secretariat's a nice guy,
the Spanish kids learn a lesson.

66
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,975
Boom. Bam! Done!

67
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:04,187
But Secretariat never actually taught math
in South Central.

68
00:04:04,296 --> 00:04:08,132
I don't know what Secretariat did
or didn't do. I wasn't there.

69
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:11,093
- Yeah, but...
- Okay, so the studio wants gangbangers,

70
00:04:11,094 --> 00:04:12,529
we'll give them gangbangers.

71
00:04:12,595 --> 00:04:14,906
- We get paid either way, right?
- I guess.

72
00:04:14,973 --> 00:04:18,142
I can't wait to get home.
I got a coq au vin in the slow cooker.

73
00:04:18,143 --> 00:04:19,452
You like coq au vin?

74
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,562
I think so. Is that the move
where a French girl pours soup in...

75
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:24,106
Come over for dinner, okay?

76
00:04:24,107 --> 00:04:25,500
- You'll love it.
- Okay.

77
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:28,986
Chin up, big guy.
So, we ain't making Casablanca.

78
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:35,200
- BoJack. Shut up.
- Aah! What are you...?

79
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:36,701
No one can know I'm here.

80
00:04:36,702 --> 00:04:38,763
- What?
- Shut your stupid mouth, you idiot.

81
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,832
As you know, you're my favorite client.

82
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,644
If I left Vigor,
would you follow me to a new agency?

83
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:47,587
Sure, but no one's gonna hire me
after this movie comes out.

84
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:51,216
The script turned into a piece of shit,
and the director is a total hack.

85
00:04:51,217 --> 00:04:52,527
Good guy, total hack.

86
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:55,012
Let's get you something
before the movie comes out.

87
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:58,032
We got an offer in for this new play
off-Broadway.

88
00:04:58,099 --> 00:04:59,867
Theater? That's what real actors do.

89
00:04:59,934 --> 00:05:02,495
Yeah, I told them that,
but they said she wanted you.

90
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:05,063
- She?
- Yeah, this hot new playwright Jill Pill.

91
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:06,940
- She came out of nowhere.
- Jill Pill?

92
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:09,443
New York Magazine called her
the enfant terrible

93
00:05:09,444 --> 00:05:10,944
of the immersive theater world,

94
00:05:10,945 --> 00:05:13,381
and then later clarified
that that's a compliment.

95
00:05:13,448 --> 00:05:16,033
It sounds like the kind of thing
I should be doing now.

96
00:05:16,034 --> 00:05:19,411
- Something artistic and bold.
- Rehearsals start in two weeks.

97
00:05:19,412 --> 00:05:21,681
Are you ready to go to New York
for six months?

98
00:05:21,747 --> 00:05:24,416
New York's a great city to live in
for six months

99
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:27,937
and not a second longer and only
if you're insanely wealthy. I can't wait!

100
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:33,192
Now, that's a lot of apple sauce.

101
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,177
Apple sauce!

102
00:05:35,178 --> 00:05:36,321
Oh-ho!

103
00:05:36,388 --> 00:05:37,637
That was so funny.

104
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:40,140
Which one of you guys
wrote all those funny jokes?

105
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:44,663
No, Todd, here at Shenanigags,
we make things up on the spot.

106
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:47,856
- Let's try it. Give me a suggestion.
- Uh... I don't know.

107
00:05:47,857 --> 00:05:49,083
Suggestions?

108
00:05:50,068 --> 00:05:52,211
Your suggestion was "suggestions."

109
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:54,964
- Way to break the fourth wall.
- That wasn't that funny.

110
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:58,009
My name's Bryan
and you haven't won me over yet.

111
00:05:58,076 --> 00:05:59,784
- Oh, Bryan.
- Todd, in improv,

112
00:05:59,785 --> 00:06:03,080
we get suggestions from an audience
then make up scenes based on them.

113
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:06,708
There are just a few simple rules.
You don't ask questions. You don't say no.

114
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:10,813
No matter what. When someone makes a
suggestion, you always try to build on it.

115
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:12,815
We call that "yes, and..."

116
00:06:12,882 --> 00:06:17,302
Yes, and if you mess up, that's okay.
It's all part of the fun.

117
00:06:17,303 --> 00:06:18,863
Is it really that simple?

118
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,534
Ugh! It's incredibly complicated
and requires years of training.

119
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:23,517
Oh, Bryan.

120
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,648
But improv isn't just about a constant
clamoring for attention and validation.

121
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:30,732
It's about community.

122
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:33,277
I've always wanted to be part
of a community.

123
00:06:33,278 --> 00:06:35,796
Well, you are now.
Your first class is $200.

124
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:37,739
I thought you said it was free.

125
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,468
Oh, that was just me doing an improv.

126
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:45,747
I am so proud of you.

127
00:06:45,748 --> 00:06:49,268
Every day I'm telling people all about
the great stuff you're doing there.

128
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:52,438
- Yeah, I don't know...
- And they say, "Wow, she sounds amazing."

129
00:06:52,505 --> 00:06:55,340
And I say, "I'm here to confirm
she is an incredible woman."

130
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:57,217
- Well...
- You know, the sound guy's wife

131
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:58,677
works with at-risk teens.

132
00:06:58,678 --> 00:07:02,681
And I was like, "Yeah, that's okay,
but compared to what my wife is doing,

133
00:07:02,682 --> 00:07:04,450
- your wife is bullshit!"
- Oh.

134
00:07:04,517 --> 00:07:05,951
And he had to agree with me.

135
00:07:06,018 --> 00:07:07,870
- Um...
- Because I am his boss.

136
00:07:07,937 --> 00:07:10,331
- Listen...
- Let me talk to one of the locals.

137
00:07:10,398 --> 00:07:14,126
I wanna hear someone else talk
about how what a selfless hero my wife is.

138
00:07:14,193 --> 00:07:16,003
- Oh, uh...
- Ah, now come on.

139
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:19,197
- Most refugees got their tongues cut out.
- Find one with a tongue.

140
00:07:19,198 --> 00:07:20,841
- I don't think...
- Indulge me.

141
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:21,825
Okay.

142
00:07:21,826 --> 00:07:25,304
Hello. I am refugee from village.

143
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:28,433
Hey, what's your name, Superstar?

144
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,519
Uh, my name is...

145
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,566
Coffee Maker.

146
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:40,403
Ah. Kofi Makir.
Am I pronouncing that right?

147
00:07:43,473 --> 00:07:46,975
Hey, Todd, you had some killer provs
in class today.

148
00:07:46,976 --> 00:07:50,246
Yes, and that zombie dentist scene
was so innovative.

149
00:07:50,313 --> 00:07:51,247
Eh...

150
00:07:51,314 --> 00:07:53,249
- Oh, Bryan.
- Guys, look.

151
00:07:53,316 --> 00:07:54,566
It's Copernicus.

152
00:07:55,735 --> 00:07:57,486
- Who's that?
- What are you, new?

153
00:07:57,487 --> 00:07:59,004
Yes, I am new.

154
00:07:59,071 --> 00:08:01,490
Copernicus is the founder of Shenanigags.

155
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:03,950
That guy is the Jan-Ove Waldner
of modern improv.

156
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:07,054
- Who is Jan-Ove Waldner?
- The Michael Jordan of table tennis.

157
00:08:07,121 --> 00:08:08,222
Oh.

158
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:10,349
- Let's go talk to him.
- Are you kidding?

159
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,501
You can't just go up and talk
to Copernicus.

160
00:08:12,502 --> 00:08:15,521
Man, Todd, you don't know shit.
You're just a tourist.

161
00:08:15,547 --> 00:08:16,648
No, I'm not.

162
00:08:16,715 --> 00:08:19,734
If you're one of us, prove it.
Go improv that lady over there.

163
00:08:20,176 --> 00:08:21,110
Freestyle.

164
00:08:21,177 --> 00:08:23,261
No audience, no net.

165
00:08:23,262 --> 00:08:25,930
- I don't know...
- Hey, if you're down with the prov,

166
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:27,241
you gotta prove that prov.

167
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:29,661
All right. I'll do it.

168
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:34,147
- Hello, old ma'am.
- Oh, hello.

169
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:37,984
I'm just waiting for my friend Doris.
Have you seen her?

170
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:38,961
Yes,

171
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:42,006
and she exploded?

172
00:08:42,073 --> 00:08:43,907
Doris exploded?

173
00:08:43,908 --> 00:08:46,410
- You just got prov'd!
- In your face, lady!

174
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:47,661
The streets are ours!

175
00:08:47,662 --> 00:08:50,931
- Hurray, improv! I did it!
- You have briefly won me over.

176
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,770
Poor Doris...

177
00:08:58,297 --> 00:09:01,049
That is not what I thought coq au vin was.
But it's great.

178
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,219
Well, I'm no Emeril Lagasse,
but we do get by.

179
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,722
- Oh, stop.
- Bam!

180
00:09:06,723 --> 00:09:08,766
Like Emeril? Ha, remember that?

181
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:09,701
He said "bam."

182
00:09:09,768 --> 00:09:12,394
I don't know who Emeril is,
but he sounds delightful.

183
00:09:12,395 --> 00:09:14,079
Hey, should I give him a sitcom?

184
00:09:14,146 --> 00:09:17,315
BoJack, Abe tells me
you guys are almost done with the movie.

185
00:09:17,316 --> 00:09:19,335
One week left!

186
00:09:19,402 --> 00:09:22,213
You two lovebirds gonna do
any traveling or anything?

187
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,532
I'll be traveling back and forth
to New York for the next few months

188
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:28,260
because BoJack's doing a play there
after you finish.

189
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:29,620
- Oh, I love plays.
- A play.

190
00:09:29,621 --> 00:09:32,247
That's my favorite place
to eat crinkly candies.

191
00:09:32,248 --> 00:09:35,226
Yeah, I can't wait to finally work
on something good, you know?

192
00:09:35,668 --> 00:09:36,602
Oh?

193
00:09:36,669 --> 00:09:40,439
Although I gotta hand it to your husband.
It has been a really painless shoot,

194
00:09:40,465 --> 00:09:42,765
even though the movie's gonna be
a piece of shit, right?

195
00:09:43,426 --> 00:09:45,862
- What?
- Oh, you said "piece of ship," right?

196
00:09:45,928 --> 00:09:47,178
Like shipshape?

197
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:49,514
Anyway, what were we talking about?
Who knows?

198
00:09:49,515 --> 00:09:51,349
- Okay, moving on.
- Hey, it's fine.

199
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,785
Abe knows what we're making.

200
00:09:53,436 --> 00:09:54,352
Right?

201
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,333
- Wanda, would you help me with dessert?
- Uh, okay.

202
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:04,655
Yeah.
New York is so great in the summer,

203
00:10:04,656 --> 00:10:08,032
but I don't think
we're going to be done in time.

204
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:10,261
We're looking at a ton of reshoots.

205
00:10:10,328 --> 00:10:12,162
- Are you kidding?
- Well, you know,

206
00:10:12,163 --> 00:10:15,307
because the movie's such a piece of shit
and all.

207
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:16,916
Did that hurt your feelings?

208
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,771
I mean, you're the one who said
we're not making Casablanca.

209
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:24,090
Right, because Casablanca is a movie
about a club owner named Rick.

210
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:26,760
This movie's about Secretariat,
a racehorse.

211
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:32,157
Wait, you literally meant we're not making
the actual movie Casablanca?

212
00:10:32,224 --> 00:10:36,144
That movie already exists.
Why would we make Casablanca?

213
00:10:36,145 --> 00:10:39,916
- This is a different movie.
- I think there was a misunderstanding.

214
00:10:39,982 --> 00:10:43,168
Wrong, boy-o.
There was a mister-understanding.

215
00:10:43,235 --> 00:10:46,822
And that mister is me
understanding you just fine.

216
00:10:46,823 --> 00:10:49,366
You come into my home
and you call my work shit?

217
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:51,409
- You know what I think? You're shit.
- What?

218
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,538
You think I don't get enough takes?
I'll get more takes.

219
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:57,057
Just wait, see how many takes I can get.

220
00:10:58,793 --> 00:11:02,313
Well, don't go.
We haven't had dessert yet.

221
00:11:02,421 --> 00:11:05,006
Shirley's lemon meringue? Mwah.

222
00:11:05,007 --> 00:11:07,777
I mean, it's no banana cream pie.

223
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,970
Because it's a different kind of pie?

224
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:13,198
That's right.

225
00:11:15,393 --> 00:11:17,352
Why did you have to antagonize him?

226
00:11:17,353 --> 00:11:19,145
I wasn't trying to antagonize him.

227
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:22,500
- He said, "It's no Casablanca."
- Well, what's done is done.

228
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:25,044
You're happy.
You didn't want me to go to New York.

229
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,528
Lucky me, I get to stay here

230
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:28,965
and work on this movie
that's gonna ruin my career.

231
00:11:29,031 --> 00:11:31,091
There's no reason to sulk about it, right?

232
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:34,536
Or you could sulk about it.

233
00:11:34,537 --> 00:11:36,221
Diane does raise some good points.

234
00:11:36,288 --> 00:11:37,205
No, she doesn't.

235
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:41,393
Besides, I don't think Diane's the person
you wanna be going to for life advice now.

236
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,897
Why? Just because I've been drinking
myself to sleep on your deck chairs

237
00:11:44,923 --> 00:11:49,092
and lying to my husband for the last week?
Hey, there's a Cheez-It on the shelf.

238
00:11:49,093 --> 00:11:51,362
I knew I kept these things around
for a reason.

239
00:11:52,221 --> 00:11:56,600
- I just had the most amazing prov sesh.
- No one cares, Todd.

240
00:11:56,601 --> 00:11:59,394
Hey, you guys wanna help me practice?
Make a suggestion.

241
00:11:59,395 --> 00:12:02,146
- Stop.
- Aah. Sorry, officer,

242
00:12:02,147 --> 00:12:04,566
I didn't see that stop sign.

243
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:06,044
Yes.

244
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,444
And my car runs on farts.

245
00:12:07,445 --> 00:12:08,403
Ugh!

246
00:12:08,404 --> 00:12:10,488
- Stop. No, stop it.
- Please stop.

247
00:12:10,489 --> 00:12:11,716
Not a suggestion.

248
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,136
Okay.
I just hope I impress the elder council.

249
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:17,955
I want to become a Level Two,

250
00:12:17,956 --> 00:12:22,810
so I can finally achieve clarity
on the Mainstage with the chosen ones.

251
00:12:22,877 --> 00:12:24,729
Oh, shit, Todd's in a cult.

252
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,338
What? No, improv is not a cult.

253
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:29,274
It's just a dogmatic school of thought

254
00:12:29,341 --> 00:12:31,509
taught by a for-profit organization

255
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,405
with the promise of social
and professional opportunities.

256
00:12:34,472 --> 00:12:37,116
- Ahh.
- It's a cult. And I know.

257
00:12:37,182 --> 00:12:41,370
I learned a little about cults
during that year I was a Scientologist.

258
00:12:41,437 --> 00:12:44,105
Coincidentally during that year,
I read a book about cults.

259
00:12:44,106 --> 00:12:46,190
Wait, are you saying
Scientology is a cult?

260
00:12:46,191 --> 00:12:49,193
No, Scientology is not a cult.

261
00:12:49,194 --> 00:12:50,755
Improv is a cult.

262
00:12:50,822 --> 00:12:54,675
I wanna be very clear.
This is about improv.

263
00:12:54,742 --> 00:12:58,328
- I really don't think it's that bad, guys.
- Why does anything matter, right?

264
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:00,580
Love is an illusion,
and happiness is fleeting,

265
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:04,042
no such thing as God, and all your
favorite musicians beat their wives.

266
00:13:04,043 --> 00:13:06,145
Allegedly.

267
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:07,963
Would you talk to her?

268
00:13:07,964 --> 00:13:09,023
Yes.

269
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:13,092
Yes, and I am a Nazi Kardashian.

270
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:15,887
Heyyy... Hitler.

271
00:13:15,888 --> 00:13:16,906
Please stop.

272
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:23,394
President Lohan!
Get away from that fire hose!

273
00:13:23,395 --> 00:13:24,813
Fire hose!

274
00:13:24,814 --> 00:13:26,791
Sorry I'm late, guys!

275
00:13:26,858 --> 00:13:29,860
Todd, we take tardiness seriously here
at Shenanigags.

276
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:34,364
- If you miss one more class, you're out.
- I'm sorry. But, wait, Bryan isn't here.

277
00:13:34,365 --> 00:13:37,492
- He's later than I am.
- Bryan's not gonna be at practice anymore.

278
00:13:37,493 --> 00:13:41,263
He's been negative, so Copernicus thought
he could benefit from some time away.

279
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,976
He's been reassigned to the Shenanigags
comedy cruise line, the Giggleship.

280
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:48,646
- Is that a reward or a punishment?
- That's up to Bryan.

281
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,065
Let's have no more questions
about the Giggleship.

282
00:13:51,674 --> 00:13:52,883
Oh, uh, all right.

283
00:13:52,884 --> 00:13:55,886
Well, you know,
I was actually talking to my best friend,

284
00:13:55,887 --> 00:13:59,138
and he said improv is a cult.

285
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:01,075
I mean, that's crazy, right?

286
00:14:06,564 --> 00:14:09,399
If you think Shenanigags is a cult,
you're free to go, Todd.

287
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,069
Oh, no. I don't wanna go.
I love this place.

288
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,089
My friend just doesn't know
how great you guys are.

289
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:18,009
It sounds like your friend's
not yes-and'ing you.

290
00:14:18,076 --> 00:14:19,784
Invite him to your graduation show.

291
00:14:19,785 --> 00:14:23,329
If he's too negative to support you,
you should take a good hard think

292
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,058
about if that's the kind of energy
you want in your life.

293
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:29,728
I hate good hard thinks.

294
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:35,759
I love you, too, Mr. Peanutbutter.
But I... I gotta go.

295
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,762
I'm...
Yeah, I'm building a school for deaf kids.

296
00:14:38,763 --> 00:14:41,598
The kids get jealous
if I'm talking on the phone.

297
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:42,849
Uh, okay, bye.

298
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,225
So, hey, hi.

299
00:14:44,226 --> 00:14:47,478
How long are you thinking of staying here?
Just for my own reference.

300
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:50,666
Oh, shit.
Is Wanda making you get rid of me?

301
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:52,316
No one is making me do anything.

302
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:54,503
Except keep acting in this movie you hate.

303
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:55,462
Well, yeah.

304
00:14:56,155 --> 00:15:00,366
I really thought I could do it. I thought
I could go far away and help people

305
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,911
and be this best possible version
of myself.

306
00:15:02,912 --> 00:15:04,013
And what happened?

307
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,663
I couldn't.

308
00:15:05,664 --> 00:15:07,975
I wasn't the person I thought I was.

309
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:11,229
I'd love to stay and wallow with you,
but I gotta head out.

310
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:15,256
Today we're filming what used to be the
scene where Secretariat commits suicide,

311
00:15:15,257 --> 00:15:17,759
but is now a scene where he swims
in a fishing hole

312
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,470
- with his girlfriend "Susie Side."
- Yeesh.

313
00:15:20,471 --> 00:15:23,723
If you wanna blow off work,
I'm probably just gonna sit on the couch,

314
00:15:23,724 --> 00:15:26,434
drink beer, and watch old episodes
of Horsin' Around.

315
00:15:26,435 --> 00:15:27,369
Hmm.

316
00:15:28,604 --> 00:15:30,897
And if I hear one more peep out of you...

317
00:15:33,109 --> 00:15:36,277
- Sabrina!
- What? I didn't peep!

318
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:38,256
Oh!

319
00:15:39,657 --> 00:15:42,033
Sabrina was such a little bitch.

320
00:15:42,034 --> 00:15:44,577
She was an orphan. She had a tough life.

321
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:48,206
Hey, Diane, you're still here.
And BoJack is here.

322
00:15:48,207 --> 00:15:49,457
Did you go to work today?

323
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:52,169
I was gonna, but then I remembered
everything is garbage,

324
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,586
so why bother doing anything?

325
00:15:53,587 --> 00:15:55,898
- True story.
- Okay.

326
00:15:55,923 --> 00:15:57,841
Oh, you didn't.

327
00:15:59,093 --> 00:16:01,094
Oh, you did.

328
00:16:06,058 --> 00:16:08,244
- Hello.
- Hey, could you get the door?

329
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:10,037
- Whoa.
- Mm.

330
00:16:10,104 --> 00:16:12,856
The property's gonna be ready in June.
Gives us two months

331
00:16:12,857 --> 00:16:14,941
to get everything we need
out of this place.

332
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:15,859
Mm. Perfect.

333
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,903
Just so you know, I had to register
the corporation in your name.

334
00:16:18,904 --> 00:16:20,989
- What?
- Just until the divorce is finalized.

335
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,383
Katie's lawyers are watching me closely
right now.

336
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,367
They're hawks.

337
00:16:24,368 --> 00:16:26,577
I mean, not literally.
Well, one literally.

338
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:28,639
Know what, actually, he might be a falcon.

339
00:16:28,706 --> 00:16:29,831
Rutabaga, this is too...

340
00:16:29,832 --> 00:16:32,291
This is a temporary technicality,
I promise.

341
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,961
I'm not gonna leave you holding the bag.
Okay?

342
00:16:34,962 --> 00:16:35,896
Mm. Mm.

343
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:38,565
Hey, your assistant wasn't out there,
so I just... Ooh.

344
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,383
- Oh, hello.
- Look at this urn.

345
00:16:40,384 --> 00:16:42,177
What's going on in here?

346
00:16:42,178 --> 00:16:43,904
Mr. Peanutbutter, shut the door.

347
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:49,285
Rutabaga and I are starting a new agency,
and we want you to come with us.

348
00:16:49,351 --> 00:16:52,520
Well, well, well, what delicious irony.

349
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:55,899
It appears the cat is chasing the dog.

350
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,084
Are you in or out?

351
00:16:57,151 --> 00:16:58,068
Are you kidding?

352
00:16:58,069 --> 00:17:01,255
You're the agent who got me
Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities.

353
00:17:01,363 --> 00:17:02,655
- Well...
- What do they know?

354
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:04,282
- Right, so...
- Do they know things?

355
00:17:04,283 --> 00:17:05,658
- Okay...
- Let's find out.

356
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:07,077
- Right...
- Big fan.

357
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:08,387
I like you guys.

358
00:17:08,453 --> 00:17:11,039
I like your hustle
and I like your matching lipstick.

359
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,582
- Well, um...
- I am in.

360
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:13,767
Mm-hm.

361
00:17:16,628 --> 00:17:18,480
Go home, Goober.

362
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:19,672
Yeah! Go home, Goober!

363
00:17:19,673 --> 00:17:22,651
Goober sucks.
Why doesn't he ever go home?

364
00:17:22,718 --> 00:17:24,778
Yeah, Goober's the one who should go home.

365
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:27,072
- You suck, Goober!
- Hey, Goober! Get murdered!

366
00:17:27,139 --> 00:17:29,574
Go sit on a sharp dick, you piece of shit.

367
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:32,310
- Hey, guys.
- Shut up, Todd.

368
00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:34,771
BoJack, listen, I... Oh!

369
00:17:34,772 --> 00:17:37,148
- Hey, whoa!
- Boo! Party foul!

370
00:17:37,149 --> 00:17:39,400
- You knocked over Bucking-can Palace.
- Come on!

371
00:17:39,401 --> 00:17:41,337
Uh, sorry, I'll clean that up later.

372
00:17:41,403 --> 00:17:44,948
Listen to this guy, "clean it up later."
Hasn't picked up his shit in years.

373
00:17:44,949 --> 00:17:46,300
Clean up your shit, Todd.

374
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:51,096
BoJack, I wanted to invite you
to my graduation show tomorrow night.

375
00:17:51,163 --> 00:17:53,081
- What?
- Look, I know you think

376
00:17:53,082 --> 00:17:56,310
it's just a dumb cult,
but you're my best friend

377
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:59,021
and it would really mean a lot
if you came.

378
00:17:59,088 --> 00:18:03,734
I'm gonna go down to the basement
to practice my space work.

379
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:07,905
And here I am going downstairs.

380
00:18:10,141 --> 00:18:11,075
Hello?

381
00:18:11,142 --> 00:18:15,204
- What kind of pants are you wearing now?
- What? I don't know. The normal kind.

382
00:18:15,271 --> 00:18:18,165
Yeah? Mm. Are they comfy?
A comfy pair of pants?

383
00:18:18,232 --> 00:18:19,791
I guess. Why?

384
00:18:19,858 --> 00:18:22,193
Just wondering
what kind of hit you're gonna take

385
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:25,672
when the studio sues the pants off you
for breach of contract.

386
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:28,491
They're suing me?
Also, are you wearing comfortable shoes?

387
00:18:28,492 --> 00:18:30,761
Because that was a long road to walk
to get to that punch line.

388
00:18:30,828 --> 00:18:33,121
- This is serious.
- We're not just doing bits?

389
00:18:33,122 --> 00:18:34,890
You started it with the pants thing.

390
00:18:34,957 --> 00:18:38,518
You need to go back to set.
You can't just not go to work.

391
00:18:39,503 --> 00:18:41,730
Remember, you wanted this.

392
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:48,695
Are you saying you're finally ready
to settle down with yours truly?

393
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:51,264
Darn tootin'.
I may be a professional racehorse,

394
00:18:51,265 --> 00:18:53,016
but I'm tired of running in circles.

395
00:18:53,017 --> 00:18:53,951
Cut!

396
00:18:54,018 --> 00:18:56,661
Perfect.
But let's get that last part again.

397
00:18:56,728 --> 00:19:01,774
- Anything you want me to do differently?
- No, I just think we should get it again.

398
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:03,651
You know, for safety.

399
00:19:03,652 --> 00:19:06,546
- Action!
- I'm tired of running in circles.

400
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:08,215
And again?

401
00:19:08,282 --> 00:19:09,967
I'm tired of running in circles.

402
00:19:10,034 --> 00:19:12,552
Why don't we get it like five more times?

403
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,537
I'm tired of running in circles.

404
00:19:14,538 --> 00:19:16,747
I'm tired of running in circles.

405
00:19:16,748 --> 00:19:18,958
I'm tired of running in circles.

406
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:21,169
I'm tired of running in circles.

407
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,213
I'm tired of running in circles.

408
00:19:23,214 --> 00:19:25,483
Let's get it ten more times.

409
00:19:30,262 --> 00:19:32,096
- Ta-da!
- We did it.

410
00:19:32,097 --> 00:19:34,473
- What now?
- We die, have our guts ripped out

411
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:37,495
through our noses,
and get enshrined inside of it. Duh.

412
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:39,645
Hey, BoJack,
can I talk to you for a minute?

413
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:41,873
Ooh...

414
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,083
Alone, please?

415
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,961
Oh...

416
00:19:46,028 --> 00:19:48,297
So, good news. We're gonna go on a trip.

417
00:19:48,322 --> 00:19:49,756
- Right now. You and me.
- What?

418
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:52,843
I booked us a room for the weekend.
Pack your bags, let's go.

419
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,094
Where? Why?

420
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:55,453
Less asking, more basking.

421
00:19:55,454 --> 00:19:57,663
In the sun, that is. Santa Barbara.

422
00:19:57,664 --> 00:20:00,375
- I'm not really in the mood for...
- I think some time away

423
00:20:00,376 --> 00:20:02,960
could be really good for us, as a couple.

424
00:20:02,961 --> 00:20:03,937
Oh.

425
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:06,648
I know you've been really bummed out
about the movie,

426
00:20:06,757 --> 00:20:10,652
but I don't think moping around the house
with Diane all day is healthy.

427
00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:12,387
All I've ever wanted
was to be in this movie,

428
00:20:12,388 --> 00:20:14,513
and you just want me
to put on a happy face...

429
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:18,118
Yes. There are lots of people
who don't like their jobs.

430
00:20:18,185 --> 00:20:20,395
Doesn't mean
they have to bring it home with...

431
00:20:20,396 --> 00:20:24,065
- Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
- What is that supposed to mean?

432
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:26,359
Well, come on.
You're a network executive.

433
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,128
You don't give a shit about work.

434
00:20:28,487 --> 00:20:30,964
I actually have a lot of pride
in what I do.

435
00:20:31,031 --> 00:20:32,531
What? You have a lot of pride?

436
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:35,076
Your job is to pump out garbage every year

437
00:20:35,077 --> 00:20:37,787
hoping some of the garbage
stinks less than the rest

438
00:20:37,788 --> 00:20:41,082
so you can quietly renew that garbage
and keep failing sideways

439
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,793
until you retire
to a three-point-five bedroom garbage

440
00:20:43,794 --> 00:20:45,628
in Beverly Garbage
and spend the rest of your life

441
00:20:45,629 --> 00:20:49,900
- watching your former assistant's garbage.
- I don't know where this is coming from.

442
00:20:49,925 --> 00:20:52,969
Every good thing
that ever happened to you happened

443
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,155
because of network executives like me.

444
00:20:55,222 --> 00:20:58,283
That show you spend all day watching,
your house, your career...

445
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,978
Great house, great career, great life!
Must be why I'm so happy all the time!

446
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:03,497
- You don't know...
- I don't?

447
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:07,334
My life was ruined
by a network executive like you.

448
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:11,338
Well, I'm sorry
that things have been so hard for you,

449
00:21:11,405 --> 00:21:15,283
but that doesn't give you the right to be
shitty to me. I can't be around someone

450
00:21:15,284 --> 00:21:18,220
who's just fueled
by bitterness and negativity.

451
00:21:18,829 --> 00:21:20,805
Well then, what are you doing here?

452
00:21:21,706 --> 00:21:23,434
What happened, BoJack?

453
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:26,061
Same thing that always happens.

454
00:21:26,128 --> 00:21:29,106
You didn't know me.
Then you fell in love with me.

455
00:21:29,714 --> 00:21:31,191
And now you know me.

456
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:37,514
You know, it's funny. When you look
at someone through rose-colored glasses,

457
00:21:37,515 --> 00:21:40,409
all the red flags just look like flags.

458
00:21:46,106 --> 00:21:49,400
- So, Wanda's moving out.
- Oh, shit. Because of me?

459
00:21:49,401 --> 00:21:51,068
No. Because of me.

460
00:21:51,069 --> 00:21:54,572
I'm sorry. You wanna watch another episode
of Horsin' Around?

461
00:21:54,573 --> 00:21:58,159
Where Olivia does the school project
where she pretends an egg is a baby.

462
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,138
Spoiler alert:
Ethan needs to make an omelet.

463
00:22:01,497 --> 00:22:03,140
Why won't you go home?

464
00:22:03,457 --> 00:22:06,017
I should. I know I should.

465
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:09,086
I wish I could just go home right now
and crawl into bed

466
00:22:09,087 --> 00:22:12,899
and not have to talk about anything
or explain anything.

467
00:22:13,008 --> 00:22:15,968
He would just say, "How was your day?"
And then he would say,

468
00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:19,055
"Hey, did you know the monorail
was invented by George Monorail?"

469
00:22:19,056 --> 00:22:21,182
And I would say,
"I don't think that's true."

470
00:22:21,183 --> 00:22:24,768
And he would say, "Well, if he didn't
invent it, he certainly perfected it."

471
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:27,747
And I wouldn't have to say,
"I'm sorry I left.

472
00:22:28,023 --> 00:22:29,899
I'm sorry I made things so difficult.

473
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,753
I'm sorry I'm not the person
I thought I was."

474
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:36,614
I would just say, "My day was good."

475
00:22:36,615 --> 00:22:39,259
And he would say, "I love you."

476
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,681
The longer you keep lying to him,
the harder it's gonna get.

477
00:22:44,248 --> 00:22:45,873
Can I ask you something?

478
00:22:45,874 --> 00:22:49,460
That play in New York,
would that really have made you happy?

479
00:22:49,461 --> 00:22:52,547
Yeah. I mean, for a little bit.

480
00:22:52,548 --> 00:22:54,107
And if Kelsey didn't get fired,

481
00:22:54,132 --> 00:22:56,467
and you got to make the movie
you wanted to make,

482
00:22:56,468 --> 00:22:58,153
would that have made you happy?

483
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,530
For a little bit.

484
00:22:59,763 --> 00:23:00,864
But then...

485
00:23:01,432 --> 00:23:02,574
Probably...

486
00:23:04,101 --> 00:23:05,619
So, what does it matter?

487
00:23:05,977 --> 00:23:08,646
But there has to be more.

488
00:23:08,647 --> 00:23:12,834
Well, when's the last time
you were actually happy?

489
00:23:23,828 --> 00:23:27,540
You microchipped my penis? Check, please!

490
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:28,767
Microchip.

491
00:23:30,502 --> 00:23:31,478
Ah.

492
00:23:43,098 --> 00:23:44,199
Oh.

493
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,270
Todd!

494
00:23:50,814 --> 00:23:53,208
Yeah.

495
00:23:56,361 --> 00:23:57,796
Oh.

496
00:23:58,238 --> 00:23:59,964
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

497
00:24:00,031 --> 00:24:01,759
Hey. How are you?

498
00:24:01,825 --> 00:24:03,802
I can't do this anymore.

499
00:24:03,868 --> 00:24:05,970
You can't do what anymore?

500
00:24:06,037 --> 00:24:08,706
I can't talk to you on the phone
all the time.

501
00:24:08,707 --> 00:24:10,016
It's too hard.

502
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,935
Uh, have you tried Bluetooth?

503
00:24:12,002 --> 00:24:15,129
I think maybe we should stop
calling each other, for a little bit.

504
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:18,358
I'm sorry. I just miss you too much.

505
00:24:18,383 --> 00:24:21,385
But listen, I love you. Okay?

506
00:24:21,386 --> 00:24:22,654
Mr. Peanutbutter?

507
00:24:23,013 --> 00:24:25,931
Uh, yeah. Uh, okay.

508
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:27,158
I love you, Diane.

509
00:24:28,435 --> 00:24:30,269
- Where is he?
- I don't know, sir.

510
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:33,164
Can't do this to me. Where the hell is he?

511
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:32,056
Boxer versus raptor.
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.
