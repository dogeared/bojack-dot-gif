1
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,200
It's a dream come true.

2
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:11,954
You've been trying to get
this movie made for 20 years.

3
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:15,791
Did you ever think you'd be sitting here,
talking about Secretariat?

4
00:00:15,874 --> 00:00:17,835
Sitting here? In this hotel room?

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,256
It's a dream come true.

6
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:24,258
What's it like to play Secretariat?

7
00:00:24,341 --> 00:00:25,342
Dream come true.

8
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:28,095
Playing Secretariat, what was that like?

9
00:00:28,178 --> 00:00:29,138
Dream come true.

10
00:00:29,555 --> 00:00:31,181
How long you in New York for?

11
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:33,016
Just a couple days of fun interviews,

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,394
then it's off to Chicago
for more fun interviews,

13
00:00:35,477 --> 00:00:38,897
and then, if I don't blow my brains out,
I get to go back to L.A.

14
00:00:38,981 --> 00:00:41,817
Darling, you're doing marvelously,
I am so proud of you.

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,902
If I could make one slight adjustment?

16
00:00:43,986 --> 00:00:45,863
Maybe fewer jokes
about how these interviews

17
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:48,073
- make you want to blow your brains out?
- Right. Sorry.

18
00:00:48,574 --> 00:00:51,243
I am so thrilled to be here,
talking with, uh...

19
00:00:51,326 --> 00:00:53,495
-Yahoo Finland.
-Yahoo Finland.

20
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,498
- Are you Finnish?
- No, we are just getting started.

21
00:00:56,582 --> 00:00:57,791
Walked right into that one.

22
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:02,254
What would an Oscar nomination
mean for Mr. BoJack Horseman?

23
00:01:02,337 --> 00:01:04,339
Any award recognition is just gravy.

24
00:01:04,423 --> 00:01:06,675
The real joy is to sit
in this hotel room all day,

25
00:01:06,758 --> 00:01:08,760
answering the same questions
over and over again.

26
00:01:08,844 --> 00:01:11,430
Great answers, you're divine.
I'm in love with you.

27
00:01:11,513 --> 00:01:14,558
One small adjustment.
I don't think sarcasm is going to read.

28
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:17,436
Just write a script for me,
so I don't have to think for myself.

29
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,688
Honey, I would shove my hand
up your ass

30
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:22,691
and control your mouth like a Muppet
if it would win you an Oscar.

31
00:01:22,774 --> 00:01:23,650
What do I know?

32
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:26,695
I'm just the publicist you hired
to help win you an Oscar.

33
00:01:26,778 --> 00:01:29,239
What's it like to play Seabiscuit?

34
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:31,366
I don't know.
You'd have to ask Tobey Maguire.

35
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,994
Your last attempt at a comeback
was The BoJack Horseman Show.

36
00:01:34,077 --> 00:01:35,037
Pass.

37
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,498
People still see you as the guy
from that sucky show from the '90s.

38
00:01:38,582 --> 00:01:40,375
Horsin' Around was not a sucky show.

39
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:43,754
- Yeah, but it was.
- It lasted nine seasons.

40
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,714
Its whole purpose
was for people to watch it

41
00:01:45,797 --> 00:01:47,257
so the network could sell ad time,

42
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:49,510
so the show could make more money
than it cost to produce.

43
00:01:49,593 --> 00:01:51,637
It did that well. It was a good show.

44
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,515
- Yes, but it sucked.
- It didn't suck!

45
00:01:55,974 --> 00:01:58,101
Great job today.
It could not have gone better.

46
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:01,438
My only note would be
stop defending Horsin' Around.

47
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,023
Why? Millions of people loved it!

48
00:02:03,106 --> 00:02:06,568
We need to use these next few months
to define your story.

49
00:02:06,652 --> 00:02:10,155
When people see you
they need to think Oscar winner,

50
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,158
not dumb asshole from an old TV show
that nobody cares about.

51
00:02:13,242 --> 00:02:14,618
Okay, I hear what you're saying,

52
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,246
but we can both agree Horsin' Around
was a good show, right?

53
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:19,122
BoJack, you know
I think the world of you.

54
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:22,960
I think you are so smart and attractive,
so I'm not going to mince words.

55
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:26,338
Horsin' Around was a piece of shit.

56
00:03:16,838 --> 00:03:20,535
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

57
00:03:22,853 --> 00:03:26,273
Looking good. Fantastic.
You need a coaster.

58
00:03:26,356 --> 00:03:28,817
I told you to wear lipstick
and underpants, Teresa.

59
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,777
I put everything bill-related
in one folder.

60
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:33,322
Gas bill, cable bill,
and the new headshots for Billy Zane.

61
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:35,449
- Thank you, Judah.
- You also wanted me to remind you

62
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:36,867
- to call Mr. Peanutbutter.
- Yeah.

63
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,994
Ping me again in two minutes?
No, five minutes.

64
00:03:39,077 --> 00:03:40,871
Uh, when's our call
with BoJack and Spanakopita?

65
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:43,707
The one that started seven minutes ago?
It started seven minutes ago.

66
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,625
What?

67
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,210
Diane's in your office right now,
stalling... poorly.

68
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:50,839
And that is my opinion on the Octomom.

69
00:03:50,922 --> 00:03:52,424
Remember Octomom?

70
00:03:52,507 --> 00:03:55,177
Diane, are you stalling
for Princess Carolyn?

71
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,512
What? You know who was good at stallin'

72
00:03:57,596 --> 00:04:00,140
was Joseph Stalin.

73
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:02,768
If anything,
Stalin was ruthlessly efficient.

74
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:04,269
Get your head out of your ass.

75
00:04:04,353 --> 00:04:09,066
He also had a city named after him.
Isn't that right, Princess Carolyn,

76
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:11,526
- who's been here the whole time?
- Hey, buddy.

77
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,612
How was your first big day
at the press junket?

78
00:04:13,695 --> 00:04:16,990
Endless. It was like
the second act of a Judd Apatow movie.

79
00:04:17,074 --> 00:04:18,659
He was exquisite.

80
00:04:18,742 --> 00:04:20,786
The movie's tracking really well
on social.

81
00:04:20,869 --> 00:04:23,664
New media impressions are up
23 percent across platforms.

82
00:04:23,747 --> 00:04:24,831
What does that mean?

83
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:27,292
Oh, I have no idea.
I assumed you would know.

84
00:04:28,293 --> 00:04:31,129
But I keep tweeting things
and they keep getting retweeted,

85
00:04:31,213 --> 00:04:32,589
so we're doing something right.

86
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:34,591
Yesterday I dropped my phone
in the bathroom

87
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:37,010
which made BoJack's Instagram
post a picture of the floor,

88
00:04:37,094 --> 00:04:39,680
with the caption "spujb."
That got 4000 likes.

89
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:41,390
- Great.
- I am exhausted.

90
00:04:41,473 --> 00:04:44,059
Being a movie star is the hardest job.

91
00:04:44,142 --> 00:04:46,561
And we get no recognition.

92
00:04:46,645 --> 00:04:48,021
Okay, you're gonna love this.

93
00:04:48,105 --> 00:04:51,858
I pulled some strings at Manatee Fair
and set up an interview tomorrow night.

94
00:04:51,942 --> 00:04:54,361
BoJack is not ready
for a magazine feature.

95
00:04:54,444 --> 00:04:56,405
Relax. It's not that big a deal.

96
00:04:56,488 --> 00:04:59,241
I didn't realize
you were an authority on deal size.

97
00:04:59,324 --> 00:05:00,242
Listen, Moussaka...

98
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:04,121
Ladies, please.
There's plenty of BoJack to go around.

99
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:07,082
I can do all the bullshit things
Ana's scheduled for me in the morning

100
00:05:07,165 --> 00:05:10,585
and still have time for Princess Carolyn's
bullshit thing tomorrow night.

101
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:12,170
Now, pajamas.

102
00:05:12,254 --> 00:05:13,171
Whaa!

103
00:05:13,255 --> 00:05:15,340
- Todd?!
- What is going on over there?

104
00:05:15,424 --> 00:05:17,384
BoJack smuggled
a young boy into his room.

105
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:19,970
No big deal.
Movie stars do it all the time.

106
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,680
Where am I?

107
00:05:21,763 --> 00:05:23,557
Bagels? Pizza?

108
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,017
Hipsters? Urine?

109
00:05:26,101 --> 00:05:29,271
- Am I in Minneapolis?
- What? No, you're in New York.

110
00:05:29,354 --> 00:05:31,064
why are you in New York?

111
00:05:31,148 --> 00:05:34,067
Beats me. Sometimes I just am places.

112
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:37,737
I can't get to sleep. Oh, God.

113
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:42,367
Yeah, that'll do it.

114
00:05:44,786 --> 00:05:49,624
Is my name Sarah Koenig?
Because I'm about to get cereal.

115
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,462
I am the queen.

116
00:05:53,545 --> 00:05:55,297
Follow me, citizens.

117
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,842
There are no sad times
in our cave of possibilities.

118
00:06:08,143 --> 00:06:09,186
Huh.

119
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:13,064
Small bottle of shampoo?!
Not on my watch!

120
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:17,652
You better not have gotten
your failure stink

121
00:06:17,736 --> 00:06:19,738
all over my important movie star clothes.

122
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:21,531
- Ohh...
- I didn't mean that.

123
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,700
You're my friend
and you don't stink of failure.

124
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:27,078
Your stink is one of good intentions
and youthful exuberance.

125
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:28,914
Hooray, compliment!

126
00:06:29,498 --> 00:06:31,583
You wanted me to ping you
regarding Mr. Peanutbutter.

127
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:34,419
Oh, fish! Guys, hold on,
I have to make a quick call.

128
00:06:34,503 --> 00:06:36,296
- What? You're already on a call.
- Sorry.

129
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:38,006
- Please hold.
- This is ridiculous.

130
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,759
- Hello?
- It's your agent!

131
00:06:40,842 --> 00:06:43,094
I wanted to remind you
of your meeting with Pinky today.

132
00:06:43,178 --> 00:06:44,763
I think I'm already in it.

133
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,643
- Do I need to be on this call still?
- I put you on conference. How do I...?

134
00:06:49,726 --> 00:06:53,563
- BoJack Horseman, is that you?!
- Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

135
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:57,275
Hey buddy, loved that bathroom floor pic
you posted yesterday.

136
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:59,611
Spujb! Classic BoJack.

137
00:06:59,694 --> 00:07:02,197
We should get together sometime
and take a selfie.

138
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,451
I'd love to, buddy,
but I'm kinda in New York right now.

139
00:07:06,535 --> 00:07:09,329
New York City?!
They make such great salsa.

140
00:07:09,412 --> 00:07:11,998
I'm here too, honey.
Have a great meeting!

141
00:07:12,082 --> 00:07:14,334
Diane?! Wait, you went to New York?

142
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:16,127
- No. I'm just on--
- Why wouldn't you tell me?

143
00:07:16,211 --> 00:07:17,587
How long are you-- I'm not accusing.

144
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:21,883
I just... I feel safer when I know
that I know where you are.

145
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:23,885
- I affirm your feelings...
- I don't want to--

146
00:07:23,969 --> 00:07:25,428
...your feelings have value,

147
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:27,973
but I'm not in New York,
I'm just on the conference call.

148
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:30,058
- Guys, can we...
-  I feel heard.

149
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:32,769
- I hear that you feel heard.
- What the hell is happening?

150
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:36,022
- Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter, I'm in New York!
- What?!

151
00:07:36,106 --> 00:07:39,317
As Carrie from
Sex and the City might say...

152
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:42,696
- I'm Carrie.
- Todd? In the naked city?

153
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:47,367
That is going to lead
to some wackiness. You mark my words.

154
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:51,329
Would you guys literally mark my words?
I do want to refer back to this later on.

155
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:53,290
We're in the middle of a meeting!

156
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:56,084
Got to go.
It's always "Rabbit, Run" with this guy.

157
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:57,168
Right?

158
00:07:57,252 --> 00:08:00,839
Oh, yeah. Somebody did their research
on J.D. Salinger.

159
00:08:00,922 --> 00:08:01,923
Rabbit, Run?

160
00:08:02,007 --> 00:08:04,718
- That's Updike, you illiterate.
- What's Updike?

161
00:08:04,801 --> 00:08:06,761
Not much, dyke, what's up with you?

162
00:08:06,845 --> 00:08:08,471
Is "dyke" an okay thing to say now?

163
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,849
Has it been reclaimed?
I honestly can't keep track.

164
00:08:11,683 --> 00:08:14,477
- Who are you asking?
- We're hanging up now, goodbye.

165
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:18,023
Wow! BoJack and Todd in the Big Apple.

166
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:22,110
I want to find one of those fortune
telling robots that can make me big!

167
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:26,573
Hey, champ,
I have a very important job for you.

168
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:28,491
Why don't you go get us some ice?

169
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,201
You don't need to patronize me.

170
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:34,456
- But, yeah, I can do that important job.
- Don't get lost, buddy!

171
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:35,582
I'm not gonna get lost.

172
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,293
The city's on a grid, why would I get...

173
00:08:44,132 --> 00:08:45,091
Oh, no.

174
00:08:45,175 --> 00:08:47,677
Hello? Are you still there?

175
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:50,805
- They may have hung up.
- I have some good news for once.

176
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:53,558
I just got promoted
to head of programming.

177
00:08:53,642 --> 00:08:56,811
I'm no longer a passenger
on the burning wreckage of an industry

178
00:08:56,895 --> 00:08:59,064
that is broadcast television.

179
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:01,399
- I'm a captain!
- What happened to Wanda?

180
00:09:01,483 --> 00:09:03,526
You didn't hear? She got poached.

181
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,654
- Oh, God!
- By another company.

182
00:09:05,737 --> 00:09:06,655
Oh, good.

183
00:09:06,738 --> 00:09:08,406
- They shot her.
- Oh, God!

184
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,575
Straight to the top
of the corporate ladder!

185
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:13,954
- Oh, good.
- She had to move to Detroit.

186
00:09:14,037 --> 00:09:17,374
- Oh, God!
- Which I hear is due for a resurgence.

187
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,501
Can we get to the goddamn point, please?

188
00:09:19,584 --> 00:09:21,920
Anyway, the network
is finally breaking even,

189
00:09:22,003 --> 00:09:24,923
thanks to the runaway success
of Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities:

190
00:09:25,006 --> 00:09:27,384
What Do They Know?
Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out!

191
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:30,637
Not to mention its companion show
Talking Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities:

192
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,222
What Do They Know?
Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out,

193
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,181
With Chris Hardwick.

194
00:09:33,264 --> 00:09:36,434
- So as long as you two stick around...
- I'm taking the show off the air.

195
00:09:36,518 --> 00:09:38,395
Wait, what? Why?!

196
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,438
I told the story I wanted to tell.

197
00:09:40,522 --> 00:09:43,775
To prolong it for commercial reasons
would be crass and inorganic.

198
00:09:43,858 --> 00:09:44,693
Uh...

199
00:09:44,776 --> 00:09:48,571
At long last the public knows
what Hollywoo stars and celebrities know

200
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:49,948
and what they don't know.

201
00:09:50,031 --> 00:09:51,616
Did they know things?

202
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,576
- Well, we found out.
- This is a nightmare.

203
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,037
Why does everything I love fall apart
as soon as I touch it?

204
00:09:56,121 --> 00:09:58,248
Oh, my ex-wife was right about me.

205
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:02,043
I am no Christopher
from the Tesla dealership.

206
00:10:06,214 --> 00:10:09,426
Is this as good as it gets?

207
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:14,681
Or are we living in the ghost town
where once my career did blossom?

208
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:18,059
Who will speak my name
when I am gone?

209
00:10:18,143 --> 00:10:22,647
Who will sing lamentations
for he who once talked soup?

210
00:10:22,731 --> 00:10:26,568
What legacy of ruin am I left with?

211
00:10:26,651 --> 00:10:30,530
What rewards have I reaped
for the damage done?

212
00:10:31,322 --> 00:10:33,825
I do not miss the spotlight's glare,

213
00:10:33,908 --> 00:10:37,996
but I do... a little, miss sunshine.

214
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,587
But before you fold the omelette,

215
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,507
I'd like the chef to hold the pan up
and whisper his or her dreams into it.

216
00:10:49,591 --> 00:10:52,969
Whisper dreams into omelette.

217
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,472
Just coffee.
Don't need to talk to it at all. Thanks.

218
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:58,141
You look different. Older. A lot older.

219
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:01,102
I'm not saying you look bad,
just much, much, much older.

220
00:11:01,186 --> 00:11:02,145
Thank you, Jill.

221
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,481
You haven't heard from Cuddlywhiskers
recently, have you?

222
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:07,358
Cuddlywhiskers? I haven't talked
to him since the show was canceled.

223
00:11:07,442 --> 00:11:08,693
I worry about him.

224
00:11:08,777 --> 00:11:11,196
About six months back, he disappeared,

225
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,489
stopped returning my calls.

226
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:16,493
I'm sure he's fine.
I mean, who returns calls?

227
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,828
Promise me you'll check on him
when you get back to L.A.

228
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:21,581
Maybe swing by his house?
I think you owe him that much.

229
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:23,541
Fine. Listen, about the play...

230
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,211
The Tragedy of Greg KingLear,
a theatrical immersion by Jill Pill?

231
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:28,254
- Right.
- That's dead. Over.

232
00:11:28,338 --> 00:11:30,173
A thing that happened
that happens no longer,

233
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,591
- like a whimper in the wind.
- Okay.

234
00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:36,679
Theater is by its very nature ephemeral.
We shout into the void, "Hey, you!"

235
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:39,682
And the void says,
"Stop shouting at me, please!"

236
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:43,436
And we grab the void and we spit
in its face, "Sir, I will not."

237
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,313
Boy, did New York do a number on you.

238
00:11:45,396 --> 00:11:48,483
Let me tell you about my next piece.
It starts with you,

239
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:51,903
BoJack Horseman,
completely naked and covered in milk.

240
00:11:51,986 --> 00:11:53,947
- I'll stop you there.
- It's a symbol for rebirth.

241
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,907
I'm not interested in being rebirthed.

242
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,368
I'm still recovering
from being birthed the first time.

243
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,912
Jill, I'm not the guy who does things
that are challenging,

244
00:12:00,995 --> 00:12:02,997
or edgy, or covered in milk.

245
00:12:03,081 --> 00:12:06,668
I'm about to be nominated for an Oscar.
I'm thinking about my legacy now.

246
00:12:06,751 --> 00:12:10,046
I want to do things that connect
with people, things that last.

247
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,173
That's the whole point, nothing lasts.

248
00:12:12,257 --> 00:12:14,175
No, I know, but see, years after I die,

249
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:16,594
people will still be able
to see me in Secretariat.

250
00:12:16,678 --> 00:12:18,346
- And then what?
- And then...

251
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:22,100
I'll be remembered.
If I win an Oscar, I'll be remembered.

252
00:12:22,183 --> 00:12:25,144
- And then what?
- Then my life will have meaning.

253
00:12:25,228 --> 00:12:27,313
- I don't know!
- Mm-hmm.

254
00:12:27,397 --> 00:12:29,399
You know what the real tragedy
of Greg KingLear is?

255
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,067
Two hours long without an intermission?

256
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,527
It's that he's a marionette.

257
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,989
And he doesn't even know someone else
is pulling his strings.

258
00:12:36,072 --> 00:12:38,908
Mmm, I don't think the chef
whispered his dreams into this.

259
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,368
This does not taste like dreams.

260
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:46,457
You told me I would be getting
more attention at a smaller agency,

261
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,501
but if anything, I'm getting less.

262
00:12:48,585 --> 00:12:51,045
Is this the best time to be on your phone?

263
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:53,715
I'm sorry.
Let me just send this one email...

264
00:12:53,798 --> 00:12:56,092
What? Why isn't it sending? Judah!

265
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,303
I'm taking my business
to Gekko Rabitowitz.

266
00:12:58,386 --> 00:12:59,762
What? No!

267
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:03,933
J.D. Salinger is too big a star to be
hamstrung by some rinky-dink operation

268
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,852
working out of a two-story warehouse.

269
00:13:05,935 --> 00:13:08,438
I need an agency
with at least nine stories.

270
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,480
Uh...

271
00:13:09,564 --> 00:13:13,776
That was a reference to my work,
with which you are clearly not familiar.

272
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,111
- Oh...
- Goodbye.

273
00:13:15,737 --> 00:13:17,572
Hello to you, Rasputin.

274
00:13:17,655 --> 00:13:20,366
- Give my regards to the czar.
- I will relay the message.

275
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,369
Oh, I don't know why
I thought I could do this.

276
00:13:23,453 --> 00:13:26,956
I'm drowning, and cats hate drowning.

277
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,709
I believe I can take on
more responsibility around here.

278
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:32,378
- On a provisional basis, of course.
- Okay.

279
00:13:32,462 --> 00:13:35,632
But we're a small agency
and we need to think like one.

280
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,258
Instead of spreading ourselves thinner,

281
00:13:37,342 --> 00:13:40,219
we should focus on better gigs
for the clients we already have.

282
00:13:40,303 --> 00:13:43,598
- Oh. Like Jerry Maguire.
- Yes.

283
00:13:44,265 --> 00:13:47,226
- What part of Jerry Maguire?
- The part where Tom Cruise's agent

284
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:50,355
got him a massive payday
for being in Jerry Maguire.

285
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:53,483
 Who's that dog?
Mister Peanutbutter

286
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,817
Princess Carolyn?!

287
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:57,654
Listen, kid, tough break about
the Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities

288
00:13:57,737 --> 00:14:00,531
Whatever, Whatever, Whatever,
but what are we gonna do next?

289
00:14:00,615 --> 00:14:03,117
I was looking forward
to taking some time off.

290
00:14:03,201 --> 00:14:06,079
What?
That is the worst idea I've ever heard.

291
00:14:06,162 --> 00:14:07,914
You're the biggest name in TV right now.

292
00:14:07,997 --> 00:14:10,416
and every network would love to air
your next project.

293
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,919
Why don't you get off your lazy keister

294
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:16,089
and come up with some TV ideas
and make us all billionaires?

295
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:17,298
Go get us some money.

296
00:14:17,382 --> 00:14:20,218
Go get it, boy. You can do it!
Go! Atta boy!

297
00:14:24,222 --> 00:14:27,016
Daddy, it's so nice having you home.

298
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,435
These last few months have been amazing.

299
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,938
My blood pressure's down,
my stress is down.

300
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:33,940
Oh, what the...?

301
00:14:34,565 --> 00:14:36,985
There's my favorite accountant!

302
00:14:37,068 --> 00:14:39,445
Great news! P.B. Livin' is back...

303
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:40,905
- No! No!
- ...in business!

304
00:14:40,989 --> 00:14:42,949
- No!
- Yes!

305
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:45,076
-Here we go!
-Oh, God, no, please.

306
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:48,288
It's gonna be great, as it always is,
from my perspective.

307
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:50,623
Dad, you promised
we were gonna play catch,

308
00:14:50,707 --> 00:14:53,668
and then we'd listen to your favorite
Harry Chapin song together!

309
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:55,295
You never told me what it was!

310
00:14:55,378 --> 00:14:57,630
Oh, it's Cat's in the Cradle,
but don't listen to it now!

311
00:14:57,714 --> 00:14:59,132
I'm gonna go listen to it.

312
00:14:59,215 --> 00:15:01,426
No! The lyrics are too relevant.
Don't do it.

313
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:03,845
No!

314
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:11,519
So, what's next for BoJack?

315
00:15:11,602 --> 00:15:15,356
What do you mean, "What's next?"
Why does everything have to have a next?

316
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,444
I just mean, after Secretariat's all over,
what are you going to do next?

317
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:23,823
We were told this feature would be
pegged to the release of Secretariat.

318
00:15:23,906 --> 00:15:27,327
It is, but we also want to get to know
the real BoJack.

319
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,995
- Do we?
- If you want the real BoJack,

320
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:30,580
there's a book written about that.

321
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,791
But that was BoJack
before the book came out.

322
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,376
Who's BoJack now?

323
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,712
Who's BoJack now? BoJack is just...

324
00:15:37,795 --> 00:15:40,131
He's a guy who could use a drink,
that's who!

325
00:15:40,214 --> 00:15:41,341
Should we order alcohol?

326
00:15:41,424 --> 00:15:44,177
Heather, could we have
a moment of privacy, please?

327
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,263
Sure. I'll just plug my ears
and sing an old sea shanty.

328
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:54,645
Sweetheart, I don't think
we need to be drinking tonight.

329
00:15:54,729 --> 00:15:57,023
Trust me, you do not want me
to do this sober.

330
00:15:57,106 --> 00:16:00,193
You don't need to micromanage
everything, okay? I'm not your puppet.

331
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,905
All right.
You clearly have everything under control.

332
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:11,454
Garçon, dos whiskey sours, por favor?

333
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,956
Actually, make it tres.
And whatever the lady wants.

334
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,751
- Did mama bear finally leave?
- She's a human, but yes.

335
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:18,544
Well, when the cat's away...

336
00:16:18,628 --> 00:16:20,630
Again, a human.
I like where you're going with this.

337
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,840
I gotta tell you,
I really loved the movie.

338
00:16:22,924 --> 00:16:24,884
You're definitely going to win an Oscar.

339
00:16:24,967 --> 00:16:27,970
That "You Are Secretariat" scene?
Oh, it made me wet.

340
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:29,222
It made you wet?!

341
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:31,432
Yeah. "Wet" is manatee slang.

342
00:16:31,516 --> 00:16:33,810
It refers to a feeling
of comfort and warmth,

343
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:36,604
because a manatee's
natural habitat is water.

344
00:16:36,687 --> 00:16:37,939
Oh, okay.

345
00:16:38,022 --> 00:16:39,941
- It also made me really horny.
- Uh...

346
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:41,317
That's narwhal slang.

347
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,069
You know, because they have horns.

348
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:53,788
When I first came to New York
I was young, full of hope.

349
00:16:53,871 --> 00:16:55,790
But you get lost in this town.

350
00:16:55,873 --> 00:16:58,584
One day you look in the mirror
and think to yourself,

351
00:16:58,668 --> 00:17:01,087
"Who is this sad, broken man?"

352
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,256
Listen, kid, I don't need your life story.

353
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:05,091
I just came out here to commit suicide.

354
00:17:05,174 --> 00:17:07,510
- No, don't!
- Crap! Forgot I could fly.

355
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,144
The first thing you notice about BoJack
is he's got a nice buzz going.

356
00:17:16,227 --> 00:17:19,230
Oh, one final question.
Are you more man than horse?

357
00:17:19,313 --> 00:17:20,982
Or are you more horse than man?

358
00:17:21,065 --> 00:17:22,275
What the hell does that mean?

359
00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:25,069
Take off your city clothes
and let's be animals!

360
00:17:25,153 --> 00:17:27,155
I want to get natural!

361
00:17:28,739 --> 00:17:31,534
Okay! A manatee and a horse
making out with each other.

362
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:32,869
Just like in nature.

363
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:36,747
In the old days sailors thought
manatees were mermaids.

364
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:40,084
Remember that episode of Horsin' Around
where Sabrina wanted to be a mermaid?

365
00:17:40,168 --> 00:17:41,919
I don't want to think about that show.

366
00:17:42,003 --> 00:17:43,754
I didn't come back to your hotel room

367
00:17:43,838 --> 00:17:47,884
because you're a goofy dad who once got
his dick stuck in a vacuum cleaner.

368
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:50,511
I'm pretty sure
that never happened on the show.

369
00:17:50,595 --> 00:17:53,222
If I'm going to sacrifice
my journalistic integrity,

370
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:56,517
it's because I'm having sex
with a movie star.

371
00:17:56,601 --> 00:17:57,435
And they're off!

372
00:17:59,896 --> 00:18:01,606
- You like that, little horsie?
- Yeah.

373
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:05,318
- But I don't need you to talk.
- I'm a mermaid, baby.

374
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:08,279
- Gonna climb up onto your boat.
- What?

375
00:18:09,947 --> 00:18:13,367
- What happened?
- Sorry, I just... Give me a minute.

376
00:18:13,451 --> 00:18:17,163
You want me to touch it,
blow on it, sing it happy birthday?

377
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:18,623
No, no, just...

378
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:20,625
Why did you say
that thing about the boat?

379
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,377
I don't know, I was being sexy.
You okay?

380
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:25,713
Just forget it. You ruined it.

381
00:18:29,926 --> 00:18:32,512
You want to talk about it?

382
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:36,557
There's nothing to talk about.
It was a misunderstanding, that's all.

383
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:40,228
She just walked in
at the worst possible...

384
00:18:40,311 --> 00:18:42,980
It-- It wasn't my fault, uh, right?

385
00:18:43,064 --> 00:18:45,107
I don't know what you're talking about.

386
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:48,027
On the boat, there was a girl.

387
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,029
- What?
- In New Mexico.

388
00:18:50,988 --> 00:18:52,406
And she trusted me.

389
00:18:53,157 --> 00:18:56,452
I keep asking myself
if her mother didn't walk in,

390
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:57,787
would I have done it?

391
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,456
And part of me is sure
that I-- I couldn't.

392
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,001
But another part knows that's a lie.

393
00:19:04,418 --> 00:19:07,338
How do you make something right
when you've made it so wrong

394
00:19:07,421 --> 00:19:08,798
you can never go back?

395
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:12,134
I just think
you have to keep moving forward?

396
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:13,261
Yeah.

397
00:19:13,344 --> 00:19:16,556
All my life that's all I've ever done.
What's it gotten me?

398
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:19,392
Well, hey, look,
you're the star of a movie now.

399
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:21,185
You're probably gonna win an Oscar.

400
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:23,187
I'm not even in it. That's not me.

401
00:19:23,271 --> 00:19:26,774
- What do you mean, that's not you?
- I was digitally replaced.

402
00:19:26,857 --> 00:19:29,443
Special effects. None of it's me.

403
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,946
Wow, that's...

404
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:33,698
That's quite a story.

405
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:35,491
I shouldn't even be here.

406
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:37,201
It's been a long night.

407
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,330
Why don't we go to bed?
In the morning, everything will be okay.

408
00:19:55,177 --> 00:19:56,596
Oh, shit.

409
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:02,310
BoJack?

410
00:20:02,393 --> 00:20:04,520
It's 4:00 am.

411
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:07,523
No, it's 7:00. I'm in New York.
I'm calling from the future.

412
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:10,776
Is that BoJack Horseman?
What is this, a crossover episode?

413
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,819
What do you want?

414
00:20:11,902 --> 00:20:15,823
Let's say, hypothetically,
you had some information about me.

415
00:20:15,906 --> 00:20:17,283
You were gonna write about it,

416
00:20:17,366 --> 00:20:19,952
I wanted to stop you
before you could get it published.

417
00:20:20,036 --> 00:20:22,747
What would be a smart thing
I could do in that situation

418
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,165
that would change your mind?

419
00:20:24,248 --> 00:20:25,958
Are we fighting about the book again?

420
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:28,169
I don't remember
where we left off last time.

421
00:20:28,252 --> 00:20:30,254
No. Diane, not everything is about you.

422
00:20:30,338 --> 00:20:32,673
For once, I have a problem,
I need your help.

423
00:20:32,757 --> 00:20:34,800
Okay, walk me through it again?

424
00:20:34,884 --> 00:20:37,386
I don't have time!
It's already three hours later here!

425
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,222
Thanks a lot. Once again,
you've been no help whatsoever.

426
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:43,100
Spoiler from the future, you suck.

427
00:20:43,184 --> 00:20:46,562
Sorry, you don't suck. I'm just...
very stressed out right now. Bye.

428
00:20:47,605 --> 00:20:49,774
Oh, come on, come on.

429
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:53,235
I'm aware of the situation
and I'm handling it.

430
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,655
- But I haven't even--
- I'm handling it.

431
00:20:55,738 --> 00:20:57,531
I'll see you at the screening tonight.

432
00:20:57,615 --> 00:20:58,908
- But...
- Don't be late.

433
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:00,910
- BoJack!
- Huh?

434
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,870
There you are. Stay right there.

435
00:21:02,953 --> 00:21:05,081
You will not believe the night I had.

436
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:08,209
- This city will eat you alive.
- Did you get the ice?

437
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,462
I'll be right back.

438
00:21:14,548 --> 00:21:15,675
I'm lost again!

439
00:21:17,635 --> 00:21:18,719
All right, Oxnard.

440
00:21:18,803 --> 00:21:21,806
We are looking at
a once in a lifetime opportunity.

441
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:23,933
Too bad Todd's not here.

442
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,976
He's always the best
at coming up with ideas

443
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,145
that at first might seem terrible...

444
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,481
Right.

445
00:21:30,564 --> 00:21:32,942
If he was here,
he'd probably say something like,

446
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,736
"Hey, you know what's cool?
Spaghetti strainers!"

447
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,029
Go on.

448
00:21:37,113 --> 00:21:40,282
And you'd say, "I feel like
I've seen that somewhere before."

449
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:42,451
Hah! That is so me!

450
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:45,121
And then he'd say, "What if I told you

451
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:48,541
that this spaghetti strainer
is also a hat?"

452
00:21:48,624 --> 00:21:52,128
A spaghetti strainer that's also a hat?

453
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:53,921
That is a brilliant idea!

454
00:21:54,004 --> 00:21:56,048
That's a terrible idea.
That's my point!

455
00:21:56,132 --> 00:21:57,675
Put that in the maybe pile.

456
00:21:57,758 --> 00:21:59,719
Right now, we need to focus
on TV shows.

457
00:21:59,802 --> 00:22:01,470
I'm sure Todd would suggest,

458
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:05,349
A Spaghetti Strainer
THAT'S ALSO A HAT: The TV Show.

459
00:22:05,433 --> 00:22:07,768
That's it! Todd, you've done it again.

460
00:22:07,852 --> 00:22:09,478
No! Nobody's done anything.

461
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:12,940
Oxnard, I want you to buy out
the entire spaghetti strainer warehouse.

462
00:22:13,023 --> 00:22:15,192
I mean, every spaghetti strainer they got.

463
00:22:15,276 --> 00:22:18,112
I'm putting all my money
in spaghetti strainers for this show.

464
00:22:18,195 --> 00:22:21,323
- How is this a show?
- Don't ask me. It's your idea.

465
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,458
I took care of our problem.

466
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:32,042
What did you do?

467
00:22:32,126 --> 00:22:35,671
You don't need to know anything else.
It's been taken care of.

468
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,131
Ana...

469
00:22:37,214 --> 00:22:39,675
There-- There was a moment
back at the hotel where...

470
00:22:40,342 --> 00:22:43,596
I really thought I blew it,
I was scared it was all over, and--

471
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,474
And then after, I was relieved.

472
00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:49,393
I don't know if I should win an Oscar.

473
00:22:49,477 --> 00:22:52,313
- I don't know if I want to.
- Stop punishing yourself.

474
00:22:52,396 --> 00:22:54,064
I was in New Mexico.

475
00:22:54,148 --> 00:22:58,027
None of that matters.
All that matters now is the story.

476
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,112
We get to decide what our story is.

477
00:23:00,196 --> 00:23:03,199
Nobody else gets to tell you
what your story is.

478
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:05,242
- What is my story?
- I'll tell you.

479
00:23:05,326 --> 00:23:09,163
This has been your dream for the last
30 years. You made it happen.

480
00:23:09,246 --> 00:23:13,417
An Oscar won't make you happy forever,
it won't solve all your problems.

481
00:23:13,501 --> 00:23:17,213
You win that Oscar,
the next day you go back to being you.

482
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:20,466
But that night is a really good night.

483
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:25,304
I think you deserve a really good night,
and I know how to get you there.

484
00:23:25,387 --> 00:23:27,264
Do you want that?

485
00:23:28,182 --> 00:23:29,850
Yes, I do.

486
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:33,229
Go introduce your movie. Tell your story.

487
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:35,731
Tomorrow we fly to Chicago.

488
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:41,403
Being Secretariat
isn't just about running fast.

489
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:43,614
Secretariat's a state of mind.

490
00:23:43,697 --> 00:23:47,576
It's about doing the right thing,
standing up for yourself.

491
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,872
Why, I look around and I see
a whole room full of Secretariats.

492
00:23:51,956 --> 00:23:54,208
You are Secretariat.

493
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:56,418
And you are Secretariat.

494
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:59,213
And you... are Secretariat.

495
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:07,096
BoJack, it's such a beautiful movie
and I think such a textured performance.

496
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,973
When you were on Horsin' Around,

497
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:11,976
could you ever have imagined
that you'd give a performance like this?

498
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:15,145
Yes. Actually, I imagined it a lot.

499
00:24:15,229 --> 00:24:18,148
I always knew I was more
than just a dumb TV actor.

500
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:21,777
Even if other people
didn't always know that.

501
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,530
Seriously, though...

502
00:24:25,614 --> 00:24:27,116
that TV show...

503
00:24:27,825 --> 00:24:28,993
it wasn't me.

504
00:24:29,827 --> 00:24:31,537
This movie is me.

505
00:24:31,996 --> 00:24:34,957
And I can't tell you how great it feels
to finally be doing

506
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,585
the kind of work that I can be proud of.
